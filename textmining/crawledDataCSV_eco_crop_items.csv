The roots rarely go deeper than about 35 cm. Towards the end of its lifespan it produces a long stout flowering pole. USES  The leaves yield a hard, coarse fiber used in the manifacture of twines, cordage, and sacks. The fiber cannot be spun as finely as jute and ropes tend to break suddenly. Fibers are also used to reinforce plaster boards and paper. The leaves contain hecogenin used in the partial synthesis of the drug cortisone. GROWING PERIOD  Short-lived perennial, with a yearly growth cycle of 150-270 days. Harvest can begin 2-4 years after planting, depending on temperature, and can continue up to about the 7-12th or even 20th year. At this stage the plant produce flowers and die. COMMON NAMES  Sisal. FURTHER INF  Sisal can in the tropics be grown at elevations up to 2000 m. It prefer moderate humidity. The species is indigenous to Central America and Mexico. One ton of fibre removes about 30 kg N, 5 kg P, 80 kg K, 65 kg Ca and 40 kg Mg from the field. Because the fibres themselves contain few minerals, the majority of the nutrients can be returned to the land with the pulp. The average yield is about 0.9 t/ha of dried fibres, on the best plantations in East Africa, yearly yields of 2.0-2.5 t/ha of dried fibres are obtained. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.

FURTHER INF  Scientific synonym: A. porrum. Elevations in the tropics of more than 500-1000 m are preferable for the production of leeks, but adequate yields may be obtained at sea level from local or specially selected cultivars. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher elevations, but leek normally does not produce seeds in the tropics. A cool period promotes early leaf production, but large plant may be obtained at high temperatures if they are well watered. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period and growth will continue as long as adequate soil moisture is available, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. Long days normally favour bulb development. Leek is considered to be indigenous to Levant in the eastern Mediterranean. Average yields in the tropics may be  about 5-20 t/ha or 0.5-2 kg/m˝ and in temperate regions yields may reach 45 t/ha.

FURTHER INF  Cashew is indigenous to tropical America probably northeastern Brazil. The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 30°N-25°S. In the tropics the tree can be found at altitudes between sea level and 1200 m where it often is grown on hillsides too dry and too stony for other crops. Photosynthesis pathway C3. Humidity should be high during the period of vegetative growth (65-80%) and lower during flowering. In general the minimum relative humidity should be about 20-25% and the maximum 35-75%. Rainfall during the flowering and harvesting periods may reduce yields. At rainfall below 500 mm the tree is only valuable for timber and firewood. It has been stated that both pigeon pea and castor bean are harmful if grown before cashew on the same land. Yields range from 2 kg/tree for young trees to 45 kg/tree for 15 year old trees. The tree is termite resistant and drought hardy. SOURCES (A. occidentale L.) Sims D (pers. comm.)

FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonym: B. eminii, B. bequaertii. Suriname grass is native of tropical East Africa. It can be found between latitudes 27 N and S at elevations from sea level to 1800 m. It has good drought tolerance and is adapted to a dry season of four or five months. However, it prefers 1,500 mm or more of rain. It does not do well where the dry season is more than five months. Within three months a complete ground cover can be obtained. It has a long growing season with productive active growth from spring to late autumn. It is very aggressive and there have been difficulties in forming long-term, stable associations with legumes. It may become a weed but can easily be ploughed out. It needs to be stocked heavily. Added nitrogen is required to keep it in active leafy growth. Frequent applications of nitrogen-up to six times per season-keep the grass in a very nutritious condition and improve live weight gain especially under high rainfall conditions. Dry matter yields may vary between 4-36 t/ha.

All parts produce a strong onion odour when crushed. Inflorescence may reach a height of 30-100 cm. Onions vary considerably in size, shape, color, and flavor. USES  It is grown for its edible, pungent bulbs, which are rich in calcium and riboflavin (vitamin B2). The bulbs can be eaten raw or cooked and they are often used for flavoring. GROWING PERIOD  Biennial, normally grown as an annual, growing 85-175 days. Requires two seasons to produce seeds. COMMON NAMES  Onion, Common onion, Bulb onion, Oignon, Cebolla, Speise-zwiebel, Ui, Sibuyas, Yeung ts'ung tau. FURTHER INF  Onion is probably indigenous to the mountain lands of central Asia where Afganistan, Iran and Pakistan meet. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher elevations. The production of bulbs is controlled by the photoperiod, the critical day-length varies from 11-16 hours, depending on the cultivar. A long, dry period is required for bulb ripening after the leaves have withered. A cool period promotes early leaf production. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. Bulb yields of up to 5-10 t/ha or 0.5-1 kg/m˝ can be obtained.

It has a deep and quick growing taproot. It has an angular stem resulting from three ribs starting from the base of each petiole. Leaves trifoliate, alternate set in a spiral along the stem. Leaflets oblong, lanceolate 5-10 cm long x 2-4 cm wide, pubescent likewise the stem. Lateral petioles, 2-3 mm the terminal one reaching 10-20 mm. Stipules linear 2-3 mm long, stipulets filiform 1-2 mm long. Flowers usually yellow but they may also be striated with purple streaks or plain red. Corolla 20-25 mm, with the flag 18-20 mm wide. Calyx 10-12 mm long, with 5 linear teeth. Inflorescence composed of racemes having 5-10 flowers on top of an axillary, little divided peduncle. Pods flat, with an acuminate tip, pubescent and of variable colour, 5-9 cm long x 12-13 mm wide, containing 2-9 seeds in shades of brown, red or black. There are 16,000-18,000 seeds per kg. Husks bearing deep, oblique furrows underline the septa between the seeds. The reproduction system is about 60 % autogamous, the chromosomic number is 2n = 22. USES: Pigeon pea is one of the most important grain legume components of subsistence farming systems in the semi-arid tropics. Plants are mainly grown for grain, green vegetables, and fodder. The young green seeds are eaten as vegetables and the ripe dry seeds as a pulse. The plant is also a good source of vitamin A. Ripe dry seeds can be split and made into dhal. Leaves, dried husks, seeds, and broken dhal are fed to cattle. For cut forage, it should be topped at a height of about 0.8 m. Under grazing conditions, it makes vigorous growth during the first year and then declines and ordinarily requires replanting every four to five years. The crop has long been used as a windbreak and shade for young coffee trees, forest seedling nurseries and vegetable beds, and is an important honey-producing plant. Leaves can also be fed to silkworms and lac insects and be used as green manure. It is planted as windbreaks and on contour for erosion control. It provides firewood and charcoal. Dried stalks serve for fuel, thatch and basketry. Pigeon pea is a legume, nodulated by Rhizobia of the cowpea group and is useful in rotational, alley or inter-cropping systems; providing nitrogen to the soil. KILLING T.: Does not tolerate frost, but will grow in temperatures to just above frost level. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, often grown as a warm-season annual. Growing period is 90-180 days for annual-production, and 130-365 days per year for perennials. Most varieties can mature and produce seeds in 100-300 days. When cultivated as a pulse crop, the plant is normally grown as an annual or biennial because production declines after the first year. When grown for forage or green manure it is usually maintained for no more than 5 years. The plant will die in about 10-12 years.

FURTHER INF  Scientific synonym: A. odorum, A. uliginosum, A. senescens. Chinese chives is believed to have orginated in China. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation can therefore only occur at higher elevations, but generally the plant seldom produce seeds in the tropics. Outside the tropics dormancy is induced by short days and flowering by long days. Long days also favour bulb development. A cool period promotes early leaf production. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases.

64d30958-4930-426f-bf3f-4b1167adad32,Camellia sinensis,"(L.) O. Kuntz Magnoliopsida:Dilleniidae:Theales:Theaceae tea, ti, chah, cha, tee 599 DESCRIPTION: Tea is a woody shrub with pale - dark green leaves under natural conditions reaching a height of 5-15 m. In cultivation it is usually trimmed to 1-2 m tall. It has a taproot or oblique root system. The taproot may reach 3 m deep, but 1.5 is the usual. Development of lateral roots depends on environmental conditions. The trunk is straight, monopodial and the bark brown to grey. When a dormant bud develops it produces 1 or 2 small non-serrated bracts 5-10 mm long, which drop shortly. Then 1-2 pre-leaves appear 7-30 mm long without serrations or prominent veins. Then, normally, 4-8 true leaves appear followed by a new dormant bud. The true leaves are persistent, alternate with short pedicels 5-10 mm long. The lamina is elliptical to lanceolate and 7-22 cm long and 3-8 wide. It is sharply acuminate at the apex and cuneiform at the base. All leaf types, whether pubescent or glabrous, tender or leathery, are glossy and very green. The China differs from the Assam variety in its leaf characteristic which is coreacious and smaller; 4-10 cm long and about 1.5 cm wide. Flowers are pedicellate and develop from leaf axils on young branches and are either solitary or in clusters of 2-3. The pedicel is 8-10 mm long, glabrous (sometimes villous) with 2-3 caducous, broad, rounded and ciliate bracts. There are 5-6 green sepals which are herbaceous and slightly membraneous, 3-5 mm long, glabrous to villous and continue up to the fruit. The white corulla has 7-8 petals attached to the base of the androecium, they have more than 200 stamens 8-13 mm long with yellow anthers. The 8-12 mm-long gynaeceum with a superior ovary is very pubescent. Tea is practically allogamous and pollination is by insects and wind. Fruits are capsules with loculicidal dehiscence and are 1-1.5 cm long and 2-3 cm in diameter with 1 to even 5 loculi, each with 2 seeds. Seeds are spherical to hemispherical, 0.8-1.6 cm in diameter and smooth and brown when mature. The endosperm has 2 cotyledons surrounding the embryo, the seed wall is hard and thick and adheres to an internal tegument which is thick, tough and shiny. There are 400-600 seeds to the kilo. USES: has been known for thousands of years and is one of today's most important beverages, cultivated on the 5 continents; cultivated first by the Chinese over 3000 years ago and introduced to Europe in the beginning of the 17th century. Depending on whether the leaves undergo fermentation the tea is black or green. Green leaves are steamed and dried to produce green tea or leaves are withered, fermented, and dried to provide black tea. It has a stimulant effect due to caffeine. Steam distillation of black tea yields an essential oil. Tea extract is used as a flavour in alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy desserts, candy, baked goods, gelatins, and puddings. Air-dried tea seed yields a clear golden-yellow oil resembling sasanqua oil, but the seed cake, containing saponin, is not suitable for fodder. Refined tea seed oil, made by removing the free fatty acids with caustic soda, then bleaching the oil with Fuller's earth and a sprinkling of bone black, makes an oil suitable for use in manufacture of oil for burning purposes, and in all respects is considered a favourable substitute for rapeseed, olive, or lard oils. The oil is different from cottonseed, corn, or sesame oils in that it is a non-drying oil and is not subject to oxidation changes, thus making it very suitable for use in the textile industry; it remains liquid below -18 .C. Tea is a potential source of food colours (black, green, orange, yellow, etc.). KILLING T.: 0 to -5°C depending on the cultivar, var. sinensis withstands -5°C, whereas the leaves of var. assamica are killed by 0°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Harvest of leaves may begin after 2-5 years and reaches a maximum at 7-10 years. The growth cycle is 240-365 days, fruits takes 270-360 days to mature and seeds are normally produced after 4-5 years. The economic life of the plant is about 40 years, but sometimes the shrubs are kept in production 60-70, or even 100 years. COMMON NAMES: Tea, The, Te, Tee, Tsa. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: , , , , . Tea can be grown in subtropical lowland and up to about 1800 m or even 2400-3000 m in the tropics, but the majority of the production takes place between 750 and 1500 m. Tea originates in the mountains of Southeast Asia, it is now grown between 40°N and 33°S. Hail can cause great damage and windbreaks are beneficial. To low and too high humidity can reduce yields and encourage disease. Harvesting: Terminal sprouts with 2-3 leaves are usually hand-plucked, 10 kg of green shoots (75-80% water) produce about 2.5 kg of dried tea. Bushes are plucked every 7-15 days, depending on the development of the tender shoots. One ton of tea removes 45-60 kg N, 4-7 kg P and 20-30 kg K from the field. Optimum yield is about 3.0 t/ha, in Africa average yields are between 0.5-2.0 t/ha. Because most tea plants are grown on hillsides, erosion control is often necessary. Sims D (pers. comm.)

It can be grown up to 2100 m near the equator, but it is normally grown below 900 m for commercial production. In southern India it is grown between sea level and 1500 m, and in Kenya from sea level to 1200 m. Low temperatures causes smaller fruit size and low quality. Papaya is sensetive to strong winds, hail and blown sand. Humidity should be medium to low. Yields of between 22-56 t/ha of fresh fruit are obtained in Hawaii and yields up to 80 t/ha have been reported. The yields are highest in the second and third year and they then decline rapidly.

FURTHER INF: Scientific synonyms: C. quianensis, C. paraquariensis, C. mexicana, C. occidentalis, C. sintenisii. West Indian cedar can be found naturally growing in Mexico, through Central America to Argentina. It occurs at elevations from sea level to 1500 m. The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 26°N-28°S. In its natural area of distribution, it is found in both primary and secondary evergreen to semi-deciduous lowland or lower mountain rainforest. It demands light and does not tolerate waterlogging or flooding. Widely distributed in wet forests of low elevations in tropical America. Trees are best planted in regions with very fertile soils and with perfect drainage that results in the good aeration of the soil required by the root system. Drought for part of the year does not adversely affect the health of the tree. In its natural habitat, removing trees around the seed tree and gradually opening up the canopy in the forest can encourage regeneration. The tree is often found close to streams and water requirements may on sites with less than 1200 mm of annual rainfall also depend on other sources. Annual wood production potential is 11-22 m3/ha.

e2b4fa15-2784-4e8f-8d2c-7114111c8f7f,Cocos nucifera,"Linnaeus Liliopsida:Arecidae:Arecales:Palmae coconut, cocotier, palma de coco, cocotero, côco, narial, thengai, kokospalme, ye, tree of life, tree of heaven, kalpaviriksha, tree of abundance, natures supermarket, kulau, coir fibre, (See ""Notes"" for hybrid names) 744 DESCRIPTION: The coconut is an evergreen palm, in strict botanical terms it is not a tree. It has no bark, branches, cambium or secondary growth. It is a woody, perennial monocotyledon and its trunk is a stem, which grows to about 25 m and exceptionally 30m; dwarf selections also exist. Being a monocotyledon the coconut has no taproot and adventitious roots develop continually from the bole. Roots may spread from the bole in any direction and at any angle below the horizontal for up to 10 m or more, depending on soil and water supply. The m ain roots are about 10mm in diameter with secondary and tertiary branches. When young they are coloured white to cream and have a very sharp tipped growing point below a loose root cap about 12mm long. There are no root hairs. The rate of elongation is not uniform and the root takes on a banded appearance as it matures and its colour darkens through shades of orange. When growth eventually ceases the root is brown with a tip that is rounded and blunt. The smallest branches are about 1-2mm in diameter and are short lived and frequently replaced. Where they occur at, or in wet conditions sometimes above, ground level the secondary and tertiary roots remain as very small, peg-like pneumatophores, or ""breathing roots"". It has a smooth, columnar, light grey-brown trunk, with a mean diameter of 30-40 cm at breast height, and topped with a terminal crown of leaves. Trunk slender and slightly swollen at the base, usually erect but may be leaning or curved and marked with leaf scars.. Leaves pinnate, polymorphic, feather shaped, 4-7m long and 1-1.5 m wide at the broadest part. Leaf stalks 1-2 cm in length and thornless. The inflorescence consists of female and male axillary flowers. Flowers small, light yellow, in clusters that emerge from canoe-shaped sheaths among the leaves. Male flowers small and more numerous. Female flowers fewer and occasionally completely absent; larger, spherical structures, about 25 mm in diameter. Fruit roughly ovoid, up to 15-25 cm long and composed of a thick, fibrous husk surrounding a somewhat spherical nut with a hard, brittle, hairy shell. The nut is 2-2.5 cm in diameter and 3-4 cm long. Three sunken holes of softer tissue, called ?eyes?, are at one end of the nut. Inside the shell is a thin, white, fleshy layer known as the ?meat?. The interior of the nut is hollow but partially filled with a watery liquid called ?coconut milk?. The meat is soft and jellylike when immature but becomes firm with maturity. Coconut milk is abundant in unripe fruit but is gradually absorbed as ripening proceeds. The fruits are green at first, turning brownish as they mature; yellow varieties go from yellow to brown. USES: Food: Copra, the dried coconut endosperm, contains an edible cooking oil (coconut oil). The apical region of (?millionaire salad?) is a food delicacy in areas where it is grown. Other food derivatives of coconut include coconut chips, coconut jam, coconut honey, coconut candy and other desserts. Fodder: Copra meal and coconut cake, the residues of oil extraction from copra containing approximately 20% protein, 45% carbohydrate, 11% fibre, fat, minerals and moisture, are used in cattle feed rations. Apiculture: is an important pollen source for honey production. Where sap is tapped from unopened inflorescences for toddy-making, many bees drain in the collecting pots. The honey may be greenish-yellow like the motor oil and crystal clear if monofloral. Granulation is medium (takes up to 3 months). Fuel: The high moisture content of wood and the difficulty of splitting it has made it relatively unpopular as firewood. Coconut shell charcoal is a major source of domestic fuel in the Philippines. It is also exported to Japan and the USA. Coconut oil can be used as a substitute for diesel oils, for electric generating plants and motor vehicles. Fibre: Three types of fibres are obtained from the coconut husks: mat fibre or yarn fibre, used in making mats; bristle fibre, used for brush making; and mattress fibre, used in stuffing mattresses and in upholstery. Leaflets are used in braiding mats, baskets and hats. Timber: C. nucifera timber has traditionally been used in tropical countries for the structural framework of houses. Coconut timber taken from the lower and middle parts of the trunk can be used for load-bearing structures in buildings, such as frames, floors and trusses. Coconut trunks can be used for poles, as they have great strength and flexibility. The wood can also be used for furniture and parquet flooring. Lipids: The oil contains fatty alcohol and glycerine used in soaps, detergents, shampoos cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and explosives. Alcohol: Sap from the tender, unopened inflorescence (coconut palm sap) is used in the producing areas for toddy, or tuba, a beverage obtained by natural fermentation. Tuba contains 6-7.5% alcohol. The distillation of fermented coconut toddy yields a spirit called arrack, produced commercially in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Other products: Coconut-shell flour, obtained from grinding clean, mature coconut shells to fine powder, is used as a filler in thermoplastic industry and an abrasive for cleaning machinery. Coconut-shell charcoal may be processed further into activated carbon that has many industrial applications, including general water purification, crystalline sugar preparation and gold purification. The edible mushrooms of the genus Auricularis grow well on coconut stems and are readily sold in China and elsewhere. Soil improver: Burnt husks form a useful sort of potash that is used to fertilize the trees. The husks also make valuable mulch for moisture conservation in the dry season and help to suppress weeds. Ornamental: Planted widely as an ornamental tree. Intercropping: Coconut palm is one of the most widely grown tree crops in the tropical countries. Its growth characteristics are ideal for small production and also for combining with other crops. The crown morphology and the relatively wide spacing facilitate the planting of a wide spectrum of field crops in coconut plantations. It has therefore been intercropped with cereals (cassava, sweet potatoes, yams) or fruits (bananas, passion fruit, pineapples and ground nuts) in many countries including Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines etc. KILLING T.: Will withstand a small amount of frost. The lowest temperatures tolerated for long periods are for palm 10°C, for leaves 15°C, and for flowers 20°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Flowering begins at 5-7 years, (dwarf varieties 3.5-4.5 years). The palm reaches full bearing after 10-12 years, maturity at about 15 years and lives up to between 60 and 100 years in the wild state, and 50-70 years under cultivation. There is a 360-365 day yield cycle. The inflorescence is initiated 16 months before the spathe opens and the nut takes about a year to mature from the time of pollination.

Please see notes in the EcoPort link for hybrid names. FURTHER INF.: The coconut palm probably originated from the Melanesian region. It is generally grown within 26°N and S and the most suitable climates are found between 10°N and S. For good yields coconut requires small temperature differences between day and night, because of this it is normally grown no higher than 700-950 m above sea level even at the equator. It can though be found up to 1500 m in a few areas near the equator. Areas where drainage is poor are not satisfactory unless the water rises and falls frequently, as is the case near a tidal estuary. The photosynthesis pathway is C 3. Normally 84-97% relative humidity is required for good production, 63% is about the minimum for production and the monthly mean should not fall below 60%. It is popularly known as ?Tree of Life?, ?Tree of Heaven?, ?Kalpaviriksha?, ?Tree of Abundance?, ?Natures? Supermarket? and is grown in more than 93 countries in an area of 11.85 million ha with production of 10.39 million tonnes of copra equivalent. It sustains millions of small holders for their livelihood. It also supports large number of coconut-based industries and thereby the millions of labourers, both men and women are solely depending on this crop. It is associated socially, culturally and religiously in many parts of the world. Coconut and its products including coconut oil is consumed in more than 120 countries. Sims D (pers. comm.)

Magnoliopsida:Asteridae:Rubiales:Rubiaceae coffee arabica, arabian coffee, arabica coffee, kafei, kofe, cafe, Kaffee, yebuna fire, buna 749 DESCRIPTION: A globose evergreen, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree attaining heights of up to 5-10 m (when not pruned). The root system of the mature coffee tree consists of: a taproot, which is often extensively branched, robust, and generally short (0.3 to 0.5 m), but may grow as long as 1.0 m in deep soils. A number of secondary roots develop from the taproot and grow vertically downwards. The lighter and more penetrable the soil, the deeper they will develop. Their role, together with that of the taproot, is to assist in anchorage and supplying water to the plant. Lateral roots, which are generally numerous, develop, often almost horizontally, and are further extended by a network of rootlets. They explore the superficial and richest layers of the soil. Their role is essentially to provide mineral nutrition to the plant. Its branches are opposite, long, flexible, and rather thin; its habit is semi-erect when young and spreading or pendulous when adult. The petiolate leaves are dark glossy green, simple, opposite, acuminate; having a short petiole with undulating margins and a slightly crinkled surface, they are 10-15 cm long and 4-6 cm wide, sometimes bearing interpetiolar stipules. They have a prominent leaf midrib and lateral veins. Flowers produced in dense clusters along reproductive branches in the axils of the leaves. White, sweet scented, star-shaped and carried on stout but short peduncles. Bracteoles united, forming a cup-shaped epicalyx at the base of the flower. There are 5 calyx segments halfway the length, spreading out very widely at the anthesis and 5 stamens inserted in the corolla tube. Anthers carried on long, slender, upright filaments. It is about 90% autogamous (self-fertile) thus a great number of its flowers are fertilised before anthesis. Ovary inferior, 2 united unilocular carpels, each containing a single ovule attached to the base of the carpel wall. The ovary bears a slender style, which terminates in short, pointed bifid stigmas. The ovary is in the form of a drupe, and is commonly called a cherry. The cherry is ovoid or sub-globulous, red when ripe, 10-15 mm wide and 16-18 mm long, and consists of a coloured exocarp (skin), a fleshy, yellowish-white mesocarp (pulp) and two beans or seeds (8.5-12.5 mm long, ellipsoidal in shape and pressed together by flattened surface that is deeply grooved; outer surface convex) joined together along their flat sides. When one of the two ovaries aborts, the other develops into an ovoid bean, which is commercially known as a 'peaberry'. Each bean is protected by two coats. The first, the endocarp, is thin with a fibrous texture (parchment) and the second, the perisperm, is a very fine membrane (skin or silverskin) that more or less adheres to the bean. The size and shape of the beans differ depending on variety, environmental conditions, and cropping practices. On average, they are 10 mm long, 6-7 mm wide and 3-4 mm thick. They weigh 0.15-0.20 g. Dried seeds, after removal of the silvery skin, provide the coffee beans of commerce. The optimum temperature for the germination of coffee seeds is about 30°-32°C, below 10°C germination is very slow. USES: Food: Dried seeds (?beans?) are roasted, ground, and brewed to make 1 of the 2 most popular beverages in the world. In its native Ethiopia, it has been used as a masticatory since ancient times. Cooked in butter, it can be used to make rich flat cakes. Coffee is widely used as flavouring in ice cream, pastries, candies, and liqueurs. In Arabia, a fermented drink from the pulp is consumed. Fodder: Pulp and parchment are occasionally fed to cattle in India. Apiculture: Honeybees collect nectar and pollen from the flowers. The honey is light with a characteristic flavour. Mixed coffee-orange honey is very highly valued. Timber: Wood is hard, dense, durable, takes a polish well, and is suitable for tables, chairs and turnery. The bark can be made into pulp, parchment, manure and mulch. Soil improver: The pulp and parchment are used as manure and mulches. Annual litter fall from both shade and crop trees, including pruning residues, maintain soil organic matter levels and hence the cation exchange capacity; this reduces the risk of leaching losses and permits a more efficient use of any inorganic fertilizers applied. Intercropping: is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans or rice, during the 1st few years. Poison: seeds contain caffeine, which has been described as a natural herbicide, selectively inhibiting germination of seeds of . Medicine: Reported to be analgesic, an aphrodisiac, anorexic, antidotal, cardiotonic, CNS-stimulant, counterirritant, diuretic, hypnotic, lactagogue and nervine. Coffee is a folk remedy for asthma, tropine poisoning, fever, flu, headache, jaundice, malaria, migraine, narcosis, nephrosis, opium poisoning, sores and vertigo. Other products: Coffelite, a type of plastic, is made from coffee beans. Coffee with iodine is used as a deodorant. KILLING T.: Some varieties have been reported to withstand -4°C. Temperatures at -5- -8°C may kill the plant within an hour or two. At temperatures from 0-2°C, which are not unusual in some production areas, the foliar tissue and green shoots are killed. This is manifested by almost complete defoliation of the shrubs, the drying out of the young branches (black tip), and with an appreciable loss in the harvest. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Begins to bear in 2-3 years, is in full bearing at 6-8 years, and produces economic yields for 30-40 years on average, though in some cases only 10-15 years, and in others up to 50-70 years. Plants of 80-100 years are known. Fruits mature 210-270 days after flowering, and the growth cycle is 240-330 days. COMMON NAMES: (Burmese): ka-phi, (Creole): kafe, (English): Abyssinian coffee, Arabian coffee, arabica coffee, Brazilian coffee, coffee, coffee tree, (Filipino): kafe, (French): café, caféier, (German): Bergkaffee, (Indonesian): kopi, (Khmer): kafae, (Spanish): café, cafeto, (Swahili): kahawa, (Thai): gafae, (Trade name): arabica coffee, (Vietnamese): Cà phê. FURTHER INF.: The generic name is derived from the Arabic word used for the drink, which, despite its name, may have come from the region of Kefa in Ethiopia; it is indigenous to the wet highland forests of Ethiopia. It can in equatorial regions be grown at elevations from 1300 to 2800 m, with 1500-1900 being usual, at 15°N or S it can be grown down to about 500 m. In the subtropics it is grown from sea level to 1000 m. The latitudinal range is between 22°N and 27°S. With too much rainfall the plant tends to develop wood at the expense of flowers and fruits. One to 2 months of less than 50 mm rain facilitates uniform flowering. Heavy rain during and after harvest is not desirable. It will only flower when days are 13 hours or shorter. Medium humidity is best, periods of mist and low clouds are beneficial but arabica require 2-3 drier months for the initiation of flower buds. The photosynthesis pathway is C 3. Processing: The ripe fruits of coffee are normally processed in the production area. They go through a certain number of operations, the objectives of which are to extract the beans from their covering of pulp, mucilage, parchment and film, and to improve their appearance. Two techniques are used to obtain clean coffee beans: Wet processing in which the fresh fruit is processed in three stages: a) Removal of the pulp and mucilage and washing, b) Drying of parchment coffee, c) Removal of the inner coverings, parchment, and film (hulling). Dry processing which consists of two stages: Drying of the fruit (coffee berries or cherry coffee), and b) Removal of the dried coverings in a single mechanical operation (hulling). Optimum yield of clean dry coffee beans is 2-3 t/ha obtained in Kenya, while average yields are about 0.5 t/ha in Brazil and 0.9 t/ha in Africa. An important disease in coffee is leaf rust, caused by , it is most serious at low altitudes and when trees are weakened by overbearing. Resistance breeding has reduced the severity of this disease. Just as severe is coffee berry disease caused by . Sims D (pers. comm.)

Robusta coffee is native of West Africa and the equatorial African rain forests. It can be grown at altitudes of about 1100-1300 m in equatorial regions, and down to sea level at 11°N and 13°S, which is also its the normal latitudinal range. Robosta is a more vigorous and hardier species than arabica. Photosynthesis pathway C3. With to much rainfall the plant tends to develop wood at the expense of flowers and fruits. One to 2 months of less than 50 mm rain facilitates uniform flowering. Heavy rain during and after harvest is not desirable. It will only flower when days are 13 hours or shorter. For best growth and development the relative humidity should be between 70 and 90% and periods of mist and low clouds are beneficial, but require a drier period of 1-2 months for initiation of flower buds. Neither lack of wind nor strong winds are desirable. Strong, dry, hot or cold winds, hail and heavy rain cause damage. The species can be grown in shallow soils in high rainfall areas and will stand temporary waterlogging. Well managed plantations may produce up to 2 t/ha of fresh berries.

FURTHER INF  Chives are mostly cultivated in temperate climates, but yields are generally good at higher elevations in the tropics. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher elevations. A cool period promotes early leaf production. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. Long days normally favour bulb development. SOURCES (A. schoenoprasum L.)

The root varies in length from 5-25 cm. In the second year the plant may produce an inflorescence and reach 20-100 cm in height. The inflorescence is a compound umbrel and the small flowers are white or pink. USES  The roots are eaten fresh, cooked, or pickled as a vegetable and pressed for juice, canned, or dehydrated. They are a good source of carotene, vitamins, and sugar. An essential oil is extracted from the seeds and used for flavoring and in perfumes. GROWING PERIOD  Biennial, normally grown as a cool-season annual. Carrot seeds are small and germinate slowly, and the tiny seedlings require some time to become established. Baby carrots can be harvested after 60-80 days, while full-size carrots require 70-150 days. It requires two seasons to produce seed. COMMON NAMES  Carrot, Queen Anne`s lance, Carotte Potagere, Zanahoria, Mohre Karotte, Peen, Gajar, Bortol. KILLING T  Leaves will not tolerate -1.5°C.  FURTHER INF  Carrot is native of Europe and parts of Asia. In the tropics, carrot should be grown at altitudes above 500 m for commercial production. Humidity should be moderate. Optimum temperature for germination is 15-25°C, maximum is 35°C. In the seedling stage the plants are sensitive to both high and low temperatures. Many young plants may be injured or killed on hot, sunny days. Long periods of hot weather often cause a strong flavor and cause root texture. Temperatures below 10°C tend to cause longer, more slender, and paler roots. Pale roots are also produced at temperatures above 25°C. Heavy clay soils tend to cause restricted root development and forked roots. Short days may reduce the ·-carotene content of the roots. Photosynthesis pathway C3. SOURCES (Daucus carota L.)

The trunk is large, buttressed and angled towards the base. Roots shallow. Flowers orange-red, almost  scarlet and slightly fragrant. USE: Flowers are reputed to produce bee forage. The large pods as well as the wood are used for fuel. The bark yields gum and has medicinal properties. It is planted as a shade tree and living fence in dairy farms, tea plantations and compounds and as an ornamental in gardens. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Flamboyant, Poinciana, Krishna chira. FURTHER INF: Scientific synonym: Poinciana regia. It originates from Madagascar, where it is now almost extinct. It is now widespread in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Trees can grow at higher altitudes than recommended, but flowering becomes erratic. The tree demands light and grows weakly and sparsely under shade. It grows in areas with both high and scanty rainfall. It has a superficial root system and competes successfully with the neighbouring shrubs and flowering plants, rendering bare the ground under its canopy. It should therefore be planted away from other plants in the gardens. Trees are deciduous only where the dry season is long and pronounced. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 2000 m. The range of natural occurrence is 12-15°S. The tree is fast growing and tolerant of salt winds. The tree seems to tolerate many types of soils from clay to sandy, but it prefers sandy soils.

Gaertn. oil palm, palmier à huile, palma aceitera, palma de aceite, dende, Ölpalme, youzonglu, nahkhil al zite, oilepalme, olie palm, kelapa sawit 972 DESCRIPTION: An unbranched, evergreen palm, reaching a height of 18-30 m with a stout trunk, up to 22-75 cm in diameter, covered with persistent leaf bases. The tree has adventitious roots growing from the bottom one meter of the trunk, and a few deeply penetrating roots that anchor the tree, but most of the roots grow horizontally in the top one meter of the soil, and as far away as 20 m from the bole. The stem terminates in a crown of leaves at the very top, 70-100 leaves, up to 7.5 m long, are produced in spiral succession from the apical meristem. The inflorescences are compound spikes, one borne in the axil of each leaf. The palm is monoecious and male and female flowers do not appear on the plant at the same time. Cross-pollination therefore almost always occurs. After fertilization, the female inflorescence develops into the fruit bunch. Each bunch may contain about 200 fruits. A single bunch may weigh 18-25 kg, of which 60-65% is fruit. The fruits are fibrous drupes about 4 cm long and 2 cm broad, with a pointed apex and a leathery, fairly thin exocarp surrounding the fleshy mesocarp, a hard endocarp and a seed. USES: Palm oil has saturated palmitic acids, as well as oleic and linoleic acids. It can be used in the manufacture of soap and candles and in the tin plate industry. It is the most productive species for bio-diesel. It contains vitamins A and E. Palm kernel oil is very similar to coconut oil and is used in edible fats, in the preparation of ice cream and mayonnaise, and in the manufacture of soaps and detergents. By tapping the male inflorescence, a wine can be made and the central shoot or cabbage of the palm is edible. The press cake from palm kernel oil can be used for animal feed. KILLING T.: 0 C at during rest or at early growth. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. FURTHER INF.: Elaeis belongs to the palm subfamily Cocoideae. African oil palm is indigenous to the humid tropics of West Africa. It occurs wild along the banks of rivers and streams in the transition zone between rain forest and open savanna, at latitudes between 3°N and 7°S. The cultivation is essentially limited to regions between 10°N and S. It can be found up to 1300 m in elevation near the equator. For commercial production altitudes above 500-700 m were considered unsuitable, but cold tolerance has extended this to 1500m. Growth rate is significantly affected below 20 C and there is no growth below 15 C. However, yields should not be significantly affected if the temperature drops below 20 C for a few hours at night only. With cold tolerance it can withstand temperatures of 12 C. It can tolerate temporary flooding, provided the water is not stagnant. Photosynthesis pathway C3II. Relative humidity should be higher than 75% in areas of commercial production and rainfall should be evenly distributed throughout the year. It requires adequate light and at least five hours of sunshine per day in all months of the year is desirable. Seedling growth stops at temperatures below 15 C. High winds can be harmful. CULTIVATION AND POST HARVEST TREATMENT: CROPPING SYSTEM: Oil palm can be a useful agroforestry species. On smallholdings oil palms are often intercropped with food crops such as maize, millet, cassava, cocoyams, groundnuts or bananas. This can be done for up to three years. On larger plantations, soil cover crops of legumes and grasses are often used. PROPAGATION: The plant is propagated from seed, that, however, germinate irregular and very slowly. To hasten the process, the moistened seeds can be mixed with charcoal and put in small boxes and then into polythene bags. These are laid in so called ""germinators"" for about 40 days at 38-40°C in low relative humidity. Then the seeds are allowed to absorb water and are held at 28-30°C for another 10-40 days. Seeds can also be germinated at the above temperature but without bags, then they should be watered every three days. A wet sack on the floor can help to keep the atmosphere damp. About 80% of the fresh seeds and 50-60% of stored seeds will germinate, but not at the same time and each week the germinated seeds should be removed. PRE-NURSERY: The germinated seeds are fragile and should therefore first be planted in prepared beds, trays, baskets or bags before being transferred to the field nursery. Soils for the pre-nursery should be well-drained, friable, fertile topsoil. The beds should be 20-23 cm high and not more than 120 cm wide. The trays 120 x 60 cm and 15-20 cm deep, while the baskets and polythene bags should be 23 cm deep and 10-15 cm in diameter. The sprouted seeds are planted carefully at a distance of 7.5 x 7.5 cm, their delicate roots pointing downwards and covered with 2.5 cm of soil. After 4-6 months, when the seedlings reach the 4-5 leaf stage, they are transferred to the field nursery FIELD-NURSERY: Here the seedlings are planted at a distance of 75-90 cm apart or in large polythene bags. They remain in the nursery 6-12 months before being transplanted to the field. The nursery area should be flat and near a water source. The soil should be as in the pre-nursery and organic manure should be incorporated before planting. FIELD: Seedlings should be between 10-18 months when they are transplanted to the field. It is best to move the seedlings with a substantial ball of earth (35-45 cm in diameter around their roots). When bare-root planting is necessary the roots should be dipped in a clay slurry as soon as they are lifted. Some leaf pruning may be necessary to reduce the seedlings height to about 1.2 m. The optimum planting density is about 123-140 palms per ha, which is the same as a planting distance of 8-9x9 m. New compact hybrids developed by ASD Costa Rica allow up to 170 palms per ha with corresponding yield increases due to the compact canopy; harvesting is also simplified due to their lower height. In areas with seasonal rainfall the transplanting should be done at the beginning of the rain, while in areas with a better rainfall distribution it can be done year round. LAND PREPARATION: The area around the planting holes should be cleared of all vegetation to a radius of 1 m. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Begins to bear in 3-4 years, is in full production in 8-10 years and is usually cut down at 25-35 years, when the palm gets to tall and unpractical to harvest. Specimens have been known to live 200 years. The inflorescence develops in the apical bud for two years. After pollination fruit takes 150-180 days to mature. The tree requires a growing period of at least 270 days per year, the optimum is more than 300 days and the tree can grow throughout the year. FERTILIZATION: One ton of fruit removes about 6 kg N, 1 kg P, 8 kg K, 0.8 kg Ca and 0.6 kg Mg from the field. Typical fertilizer recommendations in West Africa would be: 114 g of N, P2O5, K2O and Mg in 1:1:1:2 per seedling in the nursery, 15 kg N, 24 kg K2O, 4 kg Mg per hectare at transplantation, 15 kg N, 45 kg K2O, 7 kg Mg per hectare in the first year after transplantation, 30 kg N, 60 kg K2O, 10 kg Mg per hectare in the second year after transplantation, 30 kg N, 75 kg K2O, 17 kg Mg per hectare in all subsequent years. The fertilizer should be applied in a ring 7.5-15 cm from the seedlings and about 1.5 meter from the mature palm. IRRIGATION: Required in the early stages and later during dry periods. WEED CONTROL: An area around each palm and a passage between the palms should be kept free of vegetation. For mature palms the vegetation free area should be about 2.5 m in diameter. PEST AND DISEASES: With good care and careful selection of plants, disease control in the stand is not usually necessary. Where there is danger from rodents young plants should be protected by a wire collar. The principal diseases of oil palm are blast, freckle and anthracnose. Common pests are palm weevils, leaf miners, slug caterpillars, but also rats, porcupines, wild pigs, elephants and palm-nut vulture can damage the palms. HARVESTING: The fruit bunches are cut off or knocked down when the fruit is ripe. The correct time for harvesting is in most cultivars indicated by the change in colour from black to orange or by the fall of the first individual fruits. Usually only one bunch on the tree ripens at a time. The ripe bunches should be cut very carefully to avoid damage to the subtending leaf. YIELDS: It produces the two distinct oils, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Palm oil is obtained from the fleshy, orange mesocarp of the fruit, which contains 45-55 % oil, and palm kernel oil is obtained from the kernel or endosperm which contains about 50% oil. The best plantations yield about 30 t/ha of fruit per year. From that, about 7 tons of palm oil and 0.8 tons of kernel oil can be extracted. Oil palms can give a higher yield of oil per unit area than any other crop. In older plantations the yields are however often only about 3.5 tons oil per ha. per year. POST HARVEST TREATMENT: The fruit bunches are almost always damaged during harvest and must be taken to the factory as soon as possible and should be processed within 24 hours. Sims D (pers. comm.)

Magnoliopsida:Rosidae:Fabales:Leguminosae coral bean 1007 DESCRIPTION: It is a tree usually reaching 10-15 m in height but can become 26 m tall. The crown is rounded and the trunk short, spiny (spines 1-2 cm long), much branched, sometimes buttressed to 2 m. Bark brownish-grey or olive-brown, flaky. Leaves alternate, trifoliate. Inflorescence racemose, terminal, appearing when leaves are present, with pale brick-red or salmon flowers. USE: The young leaves are eaten as a vegetable in Java and Bali, and the flowers in Guatemala. Leaves are used as fodder. The presence of ant-repellent compounds in the nectar has been reported. The bark is used as a poultice on fresh wounds, and bark or root decoctions against beriberi. It is planted as a shade tree in cocoa and coffee plantations, for reforestation, as living fence and as an ornamental. Where rainfall is irregular and sometimes below 1000 mm per year, it has been noted to persist in prolonged drought without losing its leaves, recirculating nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from prunings. It is therefore a promising species for agroforestry systems in such areas where it would be intercropped with maize and cassava. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: coral bean, purple coral-tree. FURTHER INF: It is a pioneer species, most commonly found on the outer margins of swamps on sites that are not permanently flooded. It seems to prefer littoral locations with badly drained soils like swamps and stream banks and upland riverine marshes. In an experiment, it has shown good performance in acid soils of pH 4.3 and aluminum saturation of 80%.

Shallot can in the tropics be grown at elevations between sea level and 2500 m. The optimum photoperiod varies from 12 hours for the short-day cultivars to 15 hours for the long-day cultivars. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher elevations. A cool period promotes early leaf production. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. A dry period is required for curing the bulbs. Long days normally favour bulb development. Average fresh bulb yields in Indonesia is about 6 t/ha, under good growing conditions yields of 10-18 t/ha can be obtained.

FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: G. soja, G. hispida, Soja max. In the tropics soya bean is grown at elevations between sea level and 3000 m. The cultivation extends from 52° N to the tropics. Soya bean is very sensitive to photoperiod, a variation of 15 minutes in day length may be sufficient to inhibit flower development in a specific variety. Generally most cultivars bloom when the day-length is less than 14 hours though some will except up to 16 hours. Very short days (12 hours or less) lead to premature flowering and low yields. Soya bean is best adapted to moderate humidity, but have a fairly wide range. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II.

It can be grown as a summer crop in temperate regions. The fruits will not ripen, but the herbage is usable. Latitude: It is a tropical and sub-tropical crop normally limited to latitudes between 35°N and 25°S. Altitude: Sea-level up to 900 m. Temperature: It is very sensitive to frost. Reported temperature range for growth is 10-36°Cwith the optimum between 16-32°C. Water: Reported annual rainfall range for growth is 500-3500 mm with the optimum between 1000-3000 mm. Some cultivars give satisfactory yields in wet humid regions although most are partially drought resistant. A relative air humidity of about 70-85% during the growing period is best. Tolerates a warmer and more humid climate than kenaf, but is more susceptible to damage from frost and fog. Where rainfall is inadequate, irrigation has given good results. Radiation Range & intensity: It thrives in full sun light and is not shade tolerant. Photoperiodism: It is a short-day plant and unlike kenaf, it cannot be grown successively throughout the year. It requires 12-12.5 hours day-length for flowering and fruit production. In United States plants do not flower until short days of late fall or early winter. If flowering is not necessary as for fibre production, long light days for 3-4 months is the critical factor. Soil: Physical: It requires a permeable soil, a friable sandy loam with humus being preferable; however, it will adapt to a variety of soils. It will not tolerate floods or stagnant water. Chemical: Reported soil pH range for growth is 4.5-8.5 with the optimum between 5.5-7.5.

Liliopsida:Commelinidae:Cyperales:Gramineae See Notes barley, cebada, orge, damai, cevada, gebs, Gerste 1232 DESCRIPTION: A freely tillering cultivated grass and cereal crop reaching a height of 50-100 cm. As with wheat and oats, barley also presents two types of root systems. In the first, the seedling roots develop from germination to the tillering stage; in the second, which starts at tillering, the secondary crown roots, or adventitious roots, appear. These will serve to anchor the plant, and to provide it with water and nutrients. The depth they reach will depend on the hydric condition of the soil, its texture and structure, external and internal temperatures, and on the genetic make up of the variety. The stems of the barley plant are erect and made up of 5 to 7 hollow, cylindrical internodes or joints, separated by the nodes, which bear the leaves. As in all Gramineae, the leaves are placed opposite their neighbours along the stem. The leaves are linear lanceolate and formed of sheath, blade, auricles and ligule. The sheaths surround the stem completely. The ligule, and especially the auricles, distinguish barley from other cereal grains: they are glabrous, envelop the stem and can be pigment with anthocyanins. Flowers-spikes: the last internode of the stem extends as a rachis, which bears the spicules alternating on its nodes. Spikes of distich barleys do not have a terminal spicule as do those of wheat. Spikes can be awned, mutic (blunt) or hooded, and also can be smooth or toothed. The spikes can have two or six rows of grain, depending on the fertility of the lateral spikes. The rachis has 10 to 30 nodes, so the ears of six-row barleys can have from 25 up to 60 grains, and two-row barleys 25 to 30. The fruit is an oval, ridged caryopsis with rounded ends. The spike may be long or short, according to the plant type, but it always has several glumes with filiform awns that may diverge. Seeds are generally covered, with the palea and the lemma adhered to them, or can be open. Grains can be white in colour, blue, black, etc. Barley is predominantly autogamous. USES: In the traditional areas, most barley is use for animal feed (half of the world's barley production). In the non-traditional areas, barley's principal use is as food, followed by animal feed and use as raw material for the malting industry. Pearl barley (used in soups, or fed to live stock) is the decorticated caryopsis, while barley that is allowed to germinate and is then dehydrated is called malt. A very nourishing drink made from the latter can be used as a substitute for coffee. Barley is also used commercially in the making of beer and whiskey. The cereal is prepared for eating by boiling or parching the whole grain. It can then be ground for gruel or made into flour for baking. Barley can also be grown as a hay crop. The caryopsis is used to prepare decoctions and fluid extract. It has nutritive, emollient and anticatarrhal properties. KILLING T.: The main climatic mishap is frost damage to the seedlings, when the death of many plants can drastically thin out the crop. At the seedling stage, barley is more susceptible to freezing conditions than wheat. The minimum temperature for germination occurs between 3-4°C, the optimal temperature being about 20°C, and the maximum temperature between 28-30°C. GROWING PERIOD: Annual grass, can be harvested after 90-120 days for spring varieties, and after 180-240 days for winter varieties. COMMON NAMES: barley, food barley, feed barley, malting barley, orge, cebada, gerste, gebs, garbu, segem, schair, sheko, bongo. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonym: . Barley is grown from 70°N in Europe to arid regions near the Sahara and up to 4700 m in elevation in the Himalayas. In the tropics, the plant can normally only be successfully grown at elevations above 1800 m and in moderate to low humidity. Geographically, barley is the most widely distributed of all cereal crops. The crop is cultivated from Alten in Norway (70º N), inside the Arctic Circle, to tropical Timbuktu in Mali at around 17ºN. In the Americas, it is grown from latitude 65ºN in Alaska Nilan, 1964 to 53ºS in southern Chile. The photosynthesis pathway is C3 I. Yields in the United States vary between 1-5 t/ha while the average yields in Africa are about 1.2 t/ha. Heavy impermeable soils and light acid soils are unsuitable for barley. Sims D (pers. comm.)

The plant forms tuberous roots that are mostly located within the top 25 cm of the soil. Tubers vary largely in shape, colour and texture. The stems form running vines up to 4 m long, usually prostrate and slender, with milky juice, lateral stem-branches arising from the short stem are not usually branched. The leaves are variable, ovate-cordate, borne singly on long petioles, palmately veined, angular or lobed, depending on variety, green or purplish. At the end of the vine, trumpet shaped hermaphrodite flowers are formed during the summer; they are white or pale violet, axillary, funnel-shaped, borne singly or in cymes on short peduncles. They are, however, rare, especially in United States. In late summer and spring the plant forms round pods with flattened, hard-coated, angular seeds and there are 1-4 seed per pod. USES: It is cultivated for its edible tubers. They are eaten boiled, baked, candied with syrup, or pureed and they are processed like potatoes into fried chips, starch, flour, glucose and they can be canned and dehydrated. The tubers have a high concentration of carbohydrates in the form of sugar and starch. Plant tops and leaves are used as potherbs and the vine as a fodder. Greatly esteemed as feed for farm animals; with 3 kg green sweet potatoes equivalent to 1 kg of maize, with a food value rated 95-100% that of maize. Dry vines a have feed value which compares favorably with alfalfa hay as forage The sweet potato is being regarded as a valuable raw material for producing alcohol bio-fuel. The leaf decoction is used medicinally. KILLING T.: May be damaged below 10°C. Very sensitive to temperatures below 1°C for brief periods and 3°C for longer periods. GROWING PERIOD: Warm-season perennial herb, cultivated as an annual, may be harvested after 80-360 days. A frost-free period of 110-170 days is necessary.

FURTHER INF.: Grown between latitudes 40°N and 32°S at elevations up to 2800 m in equatorial regions, and otherwise up to about 2000 m. The species is indigenous to Central America, and the north-western part of South America. Distinct differences between day and night temperatures encourage the formation of tuberous roots. A photoperiod of less than 11 hours induces flowering, less flowering occurs at 12 hours and none at all at 13 hours daylight. Above 30°N and S little flowering occurs. Low humidity as the crop approaches maturity is beneficial. Vine cuttings are usually used for planting or transplants produced by bedding mother roots or from rooted cuttings. Optimum yields vary from 17.5 to 27.5 t/ha depending on the cultivar and growing conditions, while average yields are 5 t/ha in Africa, 10 t/ha in South America and 16 t/ha in Asia. The world highest production yield at 80 t/ha has been obtained in Israel.

Leaves alternate, palmate, petiolate, stipulate; stipules minute; petiole 2-20 cm long, blade 3-5 lobed, 12.5-18 x 11-16 cm, lobes acute or shortly acuminate at the apex, margins entire or undulating, leaf base deeply cordate, glabrous or pubescent only on the veins below, basal veins 7-9, prominent, venation reticulate. Inflorescence a cyme formed terminally on branches and complex, possessing main and co-florescences with paracladia. The plant is monoecious and flowers are unisexual; occasionally hermaphroditic flowers occur; 10 stamens arranged in 2 distinct whorls of 5 each in a single column in the androecium and in close proximity to each other. In the gynaecium, the 3 slender styles are connate to about 2/3 of their length, dilating to a massive bifurcate stigma. Female flowers with sepals up to 18 mm long, persistent; ovary 3-locular, ellipsoid, 1.5-2 mm in diameter, style bifid. Fruit an ellipsoid capsule 2.5-3 cm long, 2-3 cm in diameter, yellow, turning black. Seeds black, 2 per cell, ellipsoid, triangular-convex, 1.5-2 x 1-1.1 cm. Pollination is by insects. The rare hermaphroditic flowers can be self-pollinating. After pollination the trilocular ellipsoid fruit is formed. The exocarp remains fleshy until the seeds are mature. In Thailand, there are 2 flowering peaks, in November and May. In permanently humid equatorial regions, flowering occurs throughout the year. Fruit development needs 90 days from flowering until seeds mature. Shrubs begin to produce at 4-5 months and reach full productivity at about 3 years. The female flowers are 4-5 times more numerous than the male ones. USES: Young leaves may be safely eaten when steamed or stewed. Cooked nuts are eaten in certain regions of Mexico. The seeds yield up to 31-37% of a valuable oil. The seed oil is renewable source of non-conventional bio-diesel. Fruit hulls and seed shells can be used as a fuel. Curcas oil contains a toxin, curcasin. The seed oil as well as seeds, leaves and bark have medicinal properties. It is grown for erosion control, as living fence and as a support for vanilla and other climbers. All plant parts can be used as a green manure. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Barbados nut, castor oil, Chinese castor oil, curcas, fig nut, physic nut, pig nut, purging nut, wild oil nut (English). FURTHER INF.: It is best adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions. It occurs in grassland-savannah and thorn forest scrub but is completely lacking from the moist Amazon region. The current distribution shows that introduction has been most successful in drier regions of the tropics. It is very tolerant and thrives under a wide range of edapho-climatic conditions. It is particularly hardy at medium altitude and in humid zones. It is not sensitive to day length. Its strength as a crop comes from its ability to grow on poor, dry sites. However, like any species that being adapted as a crop the yields are correlated with inputs. It is very drought tolerant and can withstand slight frost. It has been widely reported as resistant to pests and diseases; however due to increasing use as a monoculture for bio-diesel this is proving not to be the case. NB.: It is being classified as an invasive species in the Pacific.

FURTHER INF  Mango originates from the Indo-Burmese monsoon region. It thrives in both tropical and subtropical areas within the latitudinal range is 30°N to 25°S. It can for non-commercial production be grown at elevations up to 1200 m and up to 600 m for commercial production. It does best with strongly marked seasons in the tropical summer rainfall regions with dry weather and moderate humidity for flowering and fruiting. High humidity, mist and heavy dew promote fungal attack, while low humidity and drying wind can cause wilting and strong winds may destroy the crop. In areas with two wet seasons flowering and fruit production may occur twice each year, but normally only one crop per year is produced. Very fertile soils with adequate supplies of water thoughout the year may result in luxuriant vegetative growth and poor cropping. The trees are drought-tolerant and do not seem to suffer from occasional flooding. According to Purseglove even shallow and impervious soils produce mangoes, but for optimal conditions the watertable should be below 2-2.5 m. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II. In the 10th year, a tree bears 400-600 fruits. A plantation of full-grown trees may produce 10-30 t/ha of fruit year. Average yields are, however often quit low e.g. in the Philippines 6 t/ha, in Peninsular Malaysia 3.5 t/ha and in Thailand 2.3 t/ha. SOURCES (M. indica L.) Sims D (pers. comm.)

The mature tuber may measure 1 m in length and weigh up to 2 kg. The cassava plant may be divided into two main parts: the shoot system, which consists of stem, leaves and reproductive structures or flowers; and the root system, which consists of feeder roots and tubers. The fleshy elongated tuberous roots or rhizomes, are very woody, only slightly thickened in wild varieties; under cultivation up to 2.5 m long and 10-15 cm in diameter, weighing up to 40 kg, averaging 4-7 kg; leaves usually deeply 3-7-parted with spatulate to linear-lanceolate acuminate lobes 7.5-15 cm long, glabrous, glaucous beneath and minutely puberulent along veins, long petioled; flowers in panicles, less than 1.2 cm long; capsules globose, about 1.2 cm across, with 6 winged angles; seeds 3 per capsule. USES: Cassava provides a major source of calories for poor families, because of its high starch content. With minimum maintenance, the farmers can dig up the starchy root of the cassava and eat it 6 months to 3 years after planting. Thus, people can cultivate cassava during times of conflict or natural disaster when no other food is available. The tubers have a high content of carbohydrates, phosphorous, iron, and calcium and are a valuable source of food. Cassava starch is used in cooking and cassava flour is used in puddings, biscuits and other confectionary. In Africa, people also eat the leaves of the cassava as a green vegetable, which provide a cheap and rich source of protein and vitamins A and B. (Young leaves are cooked like spinach). Various industries use it as a binding agent, because it is an inexpensive source of starch. Cassava starch is used in the production of paper and textiles and as monosodium glutamate (MSG), an important flavoring agent in Asian cooking. In Africa, cassava is beginning to be used in partial substitution for wheat flour, thus providing income to resource-poor farmers and saving foreign exchange for national Governments. The plant is also used in the production of adhesives, cosmetics, textiles, and paper. It is fed to livestock. Alcoholic beverages and ethanol for fuel are made from the tubers. The advantage of cassava for ethanol production is that the tubers may be stored in the ground for many months before processing; thus extending the factory window. KILLING T.: May not tolerate 7°C for prolonged periods and it is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial. Mature leaves may be harvested 50-70 days from insertion of the cuttings. The 'sweet' cassavas mature in 180-270 days, the 'bitter' in 12-18 months. Growing period 6-24 months, depending on cultivar and conditions. COMMON NAMES: Cassava, Manihot, Manioc, Tapioca, Guacomote Yuca, Cassave, Kelala, Marachini, Maravalli, Simul Alu, Ubi Singkong, Mangahazo, Ubi Kayu, Mun Sumpalung, Boodin, Kaspe, Katela, Bodin, Obi Kajoe, Poohoong Kahoy, Kamoteng, Tentu Neskok, Muk Shue, Pok Fung, Cassada, Aipi, Aipim Ubi, Ketalla, Macaxiera, Mandioca, Manoco, Ramu, Yautia. FUTHER INF.: Cassava is seldom grown above 1800 m in elevation in the tropics, maximum elevation for successfull cultivation is about 1000 m. Latitudinal range is 25°N to 30°S. Maximum tolerated slope is about 5°. The photosynthesis pathway is C3 II. Prefers moderate humidity. Tuber production is delayed and reduced in daylengths greater than 10-12 hours. Cassava is native to the countries between the Amazon region and southern Mexico. World production for 2004 was estimated at 204819995 metric tons. Production in Asia during the same period was 60492789 metric tons and in Africa 108974574. Area harvested in 2004: World 18051574 hectares Brazil 1754875 Congo 1842559 Indonesia 1255805 Nigeria 3531000 and Mozambique 1068500 hectares. Yields from small holders average 5-15 t/ha, but yields of up to 30 t/ha can be obtained. Scientists at two CGIAR research centers IITA and CIAT have developed elite varieties of cassava with improved qualities. IITA has discovered spontaneous polyploids in cassava, which are characterized by enormous vigor and variation in form and structure. Selections from triploids ""super cassava"" have doubled the yields of existing improved varieties with normal chromosome numbers. IITA has also introduced to Africa a wider genetic base for cassava improvement, focusing on materials with resistance to mites, mealybugs, cassava bacterial blight, tolerance to drought, low cyanogen potential, and good cooking quality. Together, IITA and CIAT launched a biological control campaign of the mealybug and are cooperating with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in the formulation of a global development strategy for cassava.

Numerous stems originating from crown buds; as the stems develop, axillary buds formed in lower leaf axils produce further stems, which build up a crown of basal buds at their base. The crown is the main source of stems produced after defoliation; axillary buds above ground develop into branches. It is deep-rooted, 2-4 m, or more in deep, well-drained soils. About 60-70% of total root mass is in the upper l5 cm of the soil profile. Inflorescences are compact racemes up to 40 mm, borne in axils of upper leaves; purple florets, 8 mm, typically papilionacious. Cross-pollinated by various species of bees. Seedpods are spirally coiled, glabrous or pubescent; pods turn from green to brown as they mature, and contain 2-5 kidney-shaped, yellow or brown seeds. A proportion of the seeds are hard, probably inversely related to temperature during seed set. USES: It is one of the highest yielding forage legumes and requires deep, well-drained fertile soils to maximize its potential. The inherent growth characteristics and good yield response to infrequent cutting make lucerne a highly suitable species for conservation as hay or silage. It is mainly grown as a fodder crop. Chlorophyll is extracted from the leaves and the flowers are a source of honey. It is grow as a cover crop to reduce erosion. It is a nitrogen fixer and estimates of annual rates range from 85 to 360 kg N/ha with a wide variation among sites. It can be grown in combination with maize for silage. Its fibers can be used in the manufacture of paper. It has medicinal properties and a yellow dye and trypsin inhibitors can be extracted from the seeds. It is compatible with non-aggressive grasses. KILLING T.: 0 C during early growth and it is known to survive temperatures of ˆ25 C in Alaska and above 50 C in California. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, lasting up to six years, but usually three to four years, growing 100-365 days per year. Spring to autumn, but main flush of growth in late spring/early summer.

FURTHER INF.: Widely distributed in temperate zones of the world, e.g. USA, southern Canada, Europe, China, southern Latin America and South Africa. The autotetraploid alfalfa originated from a diploid species, native to an area south of the Black and Caspian Seas. Alfalfa can be found up to 4000 m in elevation in Bolivia, but normally up to about 2400 m. In warm climates relative humidity should be low; hot and humid conditions promote diseases. The seed needs to be inoculated with an effective strain of Rhizobium meliloti, which requires a soil pH of at least 6.0. Lime-coated, inoculated seed has been used with success on more acid soils. More drought tolerant than other forage legumes such as red clover or birds foot trefoil. Deep-rooting ability is an important factor in drought tolerance and any adverse soil physical or chemical conditions, which restrict root growth will reduce drought tolerance. Compared with many forage species lucerne is an efficient user of water supply largely as a result of its deep taproot system. During severe drought, plants become dormant but resume growth when moisture becomes available Dry matter yields may be 10-20 t/ha. Seed yields vary from 50 to 750 kg/ha. Sims D (pers. comm.)

33044567-1efe-4c3e-bda1-a3720599e7ee,Olea europaea,"L. Magnoliopsida:Asteridae:Scrophulariales:Oleaceae olive, ulivo 1553 DESCRIPTION: It is a small, evergreen tree, averaging 12 m or more in height but kept to 6m with regular pruning. The root system is relatively shallow, and will not tolerate waterlogged soils. It has many thin branches with opposite branchlets and shortly-stalked, opposite, lanceolate leaves about 6 cm long, acute, entire and smooth, pale green above and silvery below. The bark is pale grey and the flowers numerous, small and creamy white in colour and are largely hidden by the evergreen leaves and grow on a long stem arising from the leaf axils. The olive produces two kinds of flowers: a perfect flower containing both male and female parts, and a staminate flower with stamens only. The flowers are largely wind pollinated with most olive varieties being self-pollinating, although fruit set is usually improved by cross-pollination with other varieties. There are self-incompatible varieties that do not set fruit without other varieties nearby, and there are varieties that are incompatible with certain others. Incompatibility can also occur for environmental reasons such as high temperatures. The dark purple fruit is a drupe about 2 cm long, ovoid and often pointed, the fleshy part filled with oil. The pulp is bitter, due to tannin in the raw fruit, and contains up to 20% oil. The thick, bony stone has a blunt keel down one side. It contains a single seed. The seeds of a few varieties are green when ripe and some turn a shade of copper brown. The cultivars vary considerably in size, shape, oil-content and flavor. The shapes range from almost round to oval or elongated with pointed ends. The trees reach bearing age in about 4 years. USES: Olive oil, an unsaturated fat, has recently become more valued for its health benefits; the oil component includes unsaturated fatty acid (70% to 80% oleic acid and 7% to 12% linoleic acid), and small amounts of polyphenols, tocopherols, sterols, and many aromatic compounds. The ripe fruits are pressed to extract the oil, the methods varying in different countries. Virgin oil, greenish in tint, is obtained by pressing crushed fruit in coarse bags and skimming the oil from the tubs of water through which it is conducted. The cake left in the bags is broken up, moistened, and repressed. For use as a dessert fruit the unripe olives are steeped in water to reduce their bitterness. Olive soap is made from olive oil and sodium hydroxide. The beautifully veined wood not only takes a fine polish, but is faintly fragrant, and is much valued for small cabinetwork. It was in olden days carved into statues of gods. The leaves are astringent and antiseptic. Both leaves and bark have valuable febrifugal qualities. The oil is a nourishing demulcent and laxative. Externally, it relieves pruritis, the effects of stings or burns, and is a good vehicle for liniments. With alcohol it is a good hair-tonic. As a lubricant it is valuable in skin, muscular, joint, kidney and chest complaints, or abdominal chill, typhoid and scarlet fevers, plague and dropsies. It is often used in enemas. It is the best fat for cooking, and a valuable article of diet for both sick and healthy of all ages. It can easily be taken with milk, orange or lemon juice, etc. The high position held by the Olive tree in ancient as in modern days may be realized when it is remembered that Moses exempted from military service men who would work at its cultivation, and that in Scriptural and classical writings the oil is mentioned as a symbol of goodness and purity, and the tree as representing peace and happiness. The oil, in addition to its wide use in diet, was burnt in the sacred lamps of temples, while the victor in the Olympic games was crowned with its leaves. KILLING T.: It is injured when temperatures fall below -10 degrees C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial: olives are long-lived with a life expectancy of 500 years. The trees are also tenacious, easily sprouting back even when chopped to the ground. FURTHER INF.: The olive is native to the Mediterranean region, tropical and central Asia and various parts of Africa. The olive has a history almost as long as that of Western civilization, its development being one of civilized man's first accomplishments. At a site in Spain, carbon dating has shown olive seed found there to be eight thousand years old. O. europaea may have been cultivated independently in two places, Crete and Syria. Archaeological evidence suggests that olives were being grown in Crete as long ago as 2,500 B.C. From Crete and Syria olives spread to Greece, Rome and other parts of the Mediterranean area. Olives are also grown commercially in California, Australia and South Africa. Proper pruning is important for the olive. Pruning both regulates production and shapes the tree for easier harvest. The trees can withstand radical pruning, so it is relatively easy to keep them at a desired height. The problem of alternate bearing can also be avoided with careful pruning every year. It should be kept in mind that the olive never bears fruit in the same place twice, and usually bears on the previous year's growth. For a single trunk, prune suckers and any branches growing below the point where branching is desired. Prune flowering branches in early summer to prevent olives from forming. Olive trees can also be pruned to espaliers. None of the cultivated varieties can be propagated by seed. Seed propagated trees revert to the original small-fruited wild variety. The seedlings can, of course, be grafted or chip budded with material from desired cultivars. The variety of an olive tree can also be changed by bark grafting or top working. Another method of propagation is transplanting suckers that grow at the base of mature trees. However, these would have to be grafted if the suckers grew from the seedling rootstock. A commonly practiced method is propagation from cuttings. Thirty-thirty five cm long, two-seven cm wide cuttings from the two-year old wood of a mature tree is treated with a rooting hormone, planted in a light-rooting medium and kept moist. Trees grown from such cuttings can be further grafted with wood from another cultivar. Cutting grown trees bear fruit in about four years. The type of harvest depends upon fruit use. Oil olives are harvested by hand or by mechanically shaking the tree. Those for pickling must still be harvested by hand as the fruit bruises easily. Olives will grow well on almost any well-drained soil up to pH 8.5 and are tolerant of mild saline conditions. Because the olive has fewer natural enemies than other crops, and because the oil in olives retains the odor of chemical treatments, the olive is one of the least sprayed crops. It requires a long, hot growing season to properly ripen the fruit, no late spring frosts to kill the blossoms and sufficient winter chill to insure fruit set. Hot, dry winds may be harmful during the period when the flowers are open and the young fruits are setting. The trees survive and fruit well even with considerable neglect. The olive tree has a wide range of adaptability. It requires a mild climate with warm summers and cold winters. The tree requires substantial chilling for good fruiting. Olive is considered a drought-resistant species because it thrives in areas where water stress is frequent. Olives are wind pollinated, thus flowering during rain; high temperatures and dry wind conditions are deleterious to good fruit set. Mature olive trees produce huge numbers of flowers, but the fruit set is normally below 5%. Most olive cultivars will set some fruit in a mono-cultivar culture. However, they benefit greatly from cross-pollination. Olives are picked late in autumn or winter, as the oil content and fruit characteristics change with ripening.

Depending on the degree of photosensitivity its growth duration may range from 60 to more than 200 days. It has round; jointed culm with long narrow leaves. The culm terminates in an inflorescence called a panicle. The height of the culm may vary from 20 cm to over 5 m in some deep-water rice exhibiting excellent internode elongation ability. Three types of roots are recognized in rice e.g. seminal roots, mesocotyl roots and nodal or adventitious roots. Seminal roots grow out of radicle and are temporary in nature. The radicle emerges after germination. It elongates to about 15 cm and remains functional up to seventh leaf stage. Mesocotyl roots emerge from the axis between the node of the coleoptile and base of radicle. Mesocotyl roots do not grow under normal circumstances. However, under deep seeding conditions emergence of mesocotyl roots are promoted. The rice root system is essentially adventitious, fibrous and arises from the compressed basal nodes. Roots that develop directly from the nodes are called primary roots. Primary roots produce branched secondary roots, which in turn give rise to tertiary roots and so on. The roots, which develop from nodes below the soil surface, are called crown roots and roots that develop from nodes above the soil surface are referred to as nodal roots. Nodal roots are often found in rice cultivars growing at water depth above 80 cm. Most rice varieties reach a maximum depth of 1 m or deeper in soft upland soils. In flooded soils, however rice roots seldom exceed a depth of 40 cm. Aerobic root environments, as in case of upland rice, promote development of root hairs whereas anaerobic condition as in flooded rice, retard the development of root hairs. The rice stem is known as culm. The culm is made up of a series of nodes and internodes. The node bears a leaf and in its axil between the sheath pulvinus and nodal septum a bud which may grow into a tiller. The region between two nodes is called an internode. Only a few internodes elongate. The number of internodes, which elongate ranges from 3-8. An internode whose length exceeds 5mm is usually considered as elongated. The internodes of a culm vary in length usually increasing from the lower to the upper ones. The lower internodes are compressed into a solid section. The number of nodes varies from 13 to 16 with only the upper 4 or 5 separated by long inter-nodes. Under rapid increases in water level, some deep-water rice varieties the lower inter-node can also elongate in length by over 30 cm each. The plant height is an inherited character. The plant height of the modern high yielding varieties may vary from 90 to 110 cm. with the dwarfing gene as compared to traditional tall varieties where the plant height may vary from 120 to 150 or more. The plant height in deep-water varieties with inter-node elongation ability may reach 5 m. under certain situation. A branch of the plant bearing the root, culm leaves and with or without a panicle is called a tiller. Tillers develop from leaf axils at each un-elongated node of the main shoot or from tillers during vegetative growth in an alternate order. On the culm the coleoptile and the first leaf do not produce tillers. Tillering starts from the second leaf when the fifth leaf on the main culm emerges. The primary tillers originate from the lower most nodes and give to secondary tillers, which in turn give rise to tertiary tillers. Tillering ability is a varietal character. The tall traditional varieties are usually low tillering and spreading while the modern high yielding varieties (HYV) have high tillering ability and are compact. In high tillering varieties all the tillers are not productive. Numerous environmental factors also affect tillering ability such as spacing, light, nutrient supply and cultural practices. The leaves arise from the node and are borne at an angle in an alternate phyllotaxy. Varieties differ in leaf number. A typical rice leaf consists of leaf sheath, auricle, ligule, leaf lamina or blade. The leaf sheath is continuous with the leaf blade. It encloses the culm above the node in varying length, form and tightness. The swelling at the base the leaf sheath is called pulvinus. It is above the nodal septum. The expanded portion of the leaf is called the leaf lamina or leaf blade. It has parallel venation. The prominent ridge on the lower surface is called the mid-rib. At the junction of the leaf blade and leaf sheath on the inside there are two triangular and membranous structures called ligules. On either side, there is a pair of hairy sickle shaped auricles. The white band around the junction between the blade and sheath is called the collar. The first rudimentary leaf at the base of the main culm is bladeless and two keeled bract. It is called the prophyllum. The margins of the prophyllum clasp the young tiller. Prophyllum is also present between each secondary and it's tertiary tiller. The upper most leaf below the panicle is called the flag or boot leaf. The traditional tall varieties have long droopy leaves, whereas the semi-dwarf modern HYVs have short, small and erect leaves. The floral organs of rice plants are modified shoots. The terminal internode bears the determinate inflorescence; called the panicle that bears spikelets. Panicle: The panicle consists of the panicle base, axis, primary and secondary branches, pedicel, rudimentary glumes and spikelets. The panicle axis extends from the panicle base to the apex interspersed with 8-10 nodes at two to 4 cm apart. Panicle branching is racemose. Primary branches develop from the nodes. Secondary branches develop from the primary branches. Pedicels develop from the nodes of primary and secondary branches, which bear the spikelets. The spikelet of rice consists of three flowers, two of which are reduced, in development. The enlarged cup like apex of the pedicle is homologous with a pair of glumes and called rudimentary glumes. The spikelet consists of a minute axis called rachilla, a pair of sterile lemmas glumes, lemma, palea and the flower. The lemma, palea and the included flower are together known as the floret. The sterile lemmas, lemma and palea are also called bracts. Lemma is the five-nerved keel shaped bracts, which partly encloses the palea. The tip of the lemma and palea is known as apiculus. The filiform extension of the keel of the lemma is called awn. Palea is a three-nerved bract, which fits closely to the lemma. The flower consists of six stamens and a pistil. Each stamen is composed of two celled versatile anthers borne on slender filaments. The pistil consists of an ovary with one ovule, short style and bifurcate plumose (hairy) stigma. Two fleshy, transparent structures located at the base of the flower, adnate to palea are called lodicules. Lodicules represent the perianth (calyx and corolla). The rice fruit is a caryopsis with a single seed fused to the ripened ovary wall, pericarp. Lemma and palea enclose the caryopsis. The rice grain is the ripened ovary with lemma, palea, rachilla sterile lemmas. The rice grain is also known as rough rice. The Lemma, palea, sterile lemmas, rachilla and the awn whenever present constitute the hull or husk. Dehulled rice grain is called brown rice. The caryopsis is enclosed by the pericarp. Next to the pericarp there are two layers of cells representing the remains of the integuments, or seed coat. The bulk of the caryopsis is the starchy endosperm. An aleurone layer encloses the endosperm, which lies below the tegmen. The embryo is located on the ventral side of the caryopsis. The embryo consists of plumule, mesocotyl, radicle, epiblast and scutellum. The plumule (embryonic leaves) is enclosed by the coleoptile, whereas the radicle (embryonic root) is ensheathed by coleorhiza. The embryonic axis mesocotyl is bounded on the inner side by scutellum adhering to the endosperm and on the outer side by the aleurone layer. The vascular trace fused with the lateral part of the scutellum is called the epiblast. USES: Raw or parboiled milled rice is cooked and used as food. It forms the main course of the meals for millions of people in Asia and else where. Many processed foods such as popped or puffed rice products are produced from brown rice or parboiled rice for use as breakfast cereals and snack foods. Beer, wine and spirits can be produced from the grain. Rice is mainly grown for food but it is also used in cosmetics, laundering starch, and textiles. An oil is produced and used as cooking and salad oil, for soap manufacture and it is made into a plastic packaging material. Husks are used as fuel, as an addition to concrete, for making hardboard and as an abrasive. The harvesting of rice produces straw as a by-product. Rice straw has poor palatability, bulkiness, low digestibility, low protein, high lignin and high silica contents. It is the most common feed ingredient for cattle in many developing countries in Asia and Pacific region, particularly in Bangladesh, India, Myanamar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Urea-treated rice straw as cattle feed is popular in Bangladesh. Rice straw is for making and repairing thatched houses in Bangladesh, Nepal and India. It is used for construction of grain storage structures, ropes, packaging material and bags in India. It is also used as fuel in Vietnam. In China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan rice straw is used in the production of paper. The chief by-products produced during milling are husks, bran and Œbrokens‚. Husks are used as domestic fuel in many countries. In Myanmar rice husks are used as fuel for the operation of rice mills, for parboiling in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar Nepal and Sri Lanka, in China for the production of steam or gas for power generation. Rice husks are also used as packaging and insulation material. Although rice husk exhibits a low protein and high fiber content, they are used as animal feed in Bangladesh, China and India. Rice husks on burning produce 20 % (by weight) of ash containing 90% silica. In India, rice husk ash is fillet in the rubber industry and in the steel industry as an insulating material. Rice bran is highly nutritious. It contents lipids, protein, minerals and vitamins. Because of its nutritional value, it is used as a feed for poultry and livestock. Refined bran oil is utilized as a salad oil as well as for cooking. Crude bran oil is used in the production of soap. In China oryzanol is extracted from crude bran oil, which has pharmaceutical use. De-oiled rice bran is used to for the commercial extraction of phytin. Rice brokens have a variety of uses such as animal feed, making rice flour and malt sugar for breweries. It is used in a variety of ways to prepare processed rice based food products. The seed has nutrient, remineralizing, antidiarrhoeic and emollient properties and administration is as decoction and powder. KILLING T.: Growth arrested below 10°C; rice exhibits little or no frost tolerance. GROWING PERIOD:  Annual grass, wetland types growing 80-150 days, while floating rice may require 180-200 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: Rice, riz, arroz, reis, ris, arishi, arroz, byeo, cau, chawal, dao, dhan. FURTHER INF.: Rice is grown in four ecosystems, which are broadly defined on the basis of water regimes. The ecosystems are irrigated, rain-fed lowland, upland and flood-prone, which cover 55, 25, 13 and 7% of the world's rice area respectively and account for 76, 17, 4 and 3% of the world's current rice production. The cultivation of indica is confined to areas between 0° and 25° latitude, it is seldom grown above 1200 m in elevation and performs best below 600m. They are hardy, resistant to diseases and tolerate unfavourable growing conditions. Rice can be grown very successfully in areas of low humidity and rainfall if there is adequate water available for irrigation but rice prefers medium to high humidity. The genetic diversity of O. sativa is most prevalent in the area extending over Asam, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Yunnan, China. The genus Oryza belongs to sub-family Oryzoideae of family Poaceae (Gramineae). It has two cultivated species of rice, Oryza sativa L., and Oryza glaberrima Steud. Both the cultivated species of rice are diploid (2n=24 chromosomes). The site of rice (O. sativa L.) domestication, whether one or many is debatable. Hybrid rice yields on an average 6.6 tons/ha compared with 5 tons/ha for conventional rice varieties. Sims D (pers. comm.)

FURTHER INF  Scientific synonyms: P. limensis, P. inamoenus. Lima bean is indigenous to Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. Many cultivars are in tropical areas best grown as elevations between 900-2800 m, but some will give resonable yields at sea level. Lima bean contains day-neutral genotypes that flower in daylengths of 9-18 hours and short-day types that require critical daylength of 11-12.3 hours for flowering. It require a dry period for the seeds to mature and heavy rainfall at the flowering period may reduce fertilization. Lima bean favours sloping well-drained areas and many varieties need trellising. Photosynthesis pathway C3. Optimum yield of fresh beans is 2-8 t/ha. In the tropics average production of dry seed is 1-1.5 t/ha. Yields of dry seed may reach 2-2.5 t/ha for bush types and 3-4 t/ha from climbing types.

FURTHER INF  Common bean is probably native to tropical South America. It can be found at elevations from sea level to 3000 m, most cultivars thrives between 600 and 2000 m, but cultivars for tropical sea level exist. Popping beans are grown between 1800 and 3000 m in the Andean mountains. Common bean require medium to high humidity especially at flowering, but to high humidity will, like poor drainage, generally result in disease problems. Hail can cause serious defoliation and loss of the crop. For harvesting, drying and threshing of the beans dry weather is required. Photosynthesis pathway C3. To acid soils should be avoided since the reduce the activity of the Rhizobium nitrogen fixing bacteria. Common bean is not as efficient as many other legumes in utilizing the nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria which inhabit the root system. The average yield of dried beans is 0.5-1.5 t/ha, but yields up to 2.8-5 t/ha have been reported. Yields of green pods of up to 5-7.5 t/ha have been reported. SOURCES (P. vulgaris L.)

USES  The fruits are usually eaten fresh or dried. Date pulp is a good source of calcium, phosphorous, and carbohydrates. Palm trunks can be tapped for a sap taht is made into palm wine. Palm leaves have been used as thatch and fiber. KILLING T  Leaves may tolerate -4 to -6°C and the tree -15°C. GROWING PERIOD  Perennial. Begin fruiting within 2-4 years and normally reach full production at 5-8 years, (Rice; 8-10 years) but productivity may increase up to 9-15 years. Yields decline after 40-50 years, but the tree will continue to produce up to about 75 years. COMMON NAMES  Date, Palmier dattier, Datilera, Dattelpalme, Khajur, Khaji, Thinbaw thinbaung, Tamareira, Palmera, Datilera. FURTHER INF  The tree transpires large quantities of moisture and the amount of available rainfall is often little, or entire absent in the production areas. The water requirement of the palm must be provided for by ground water (the roots of the tree can reach 2-6 m deep) or by irrigation. Irrigation is needed about every 14 days in the summer and 20-30 days in the winter. The water requirement of the palms is about 10000-50000 m3/ha per year, or 1.5 m3 per palm per week as an average over the year. Relative humidity should be between 40 and 50% during ripening time. Rain during flowering can hinder the pollination and rain during the fruit development can lead to bursting and dacay of the fruit. An average well-managed palm can produce about 60-70 kg of fresh dates per year. The palm can be grown at elevations between sea level and 1500 m. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.

Pinopsida:Pinaceae loblolly pine, Rosemary pine, oldfield pine, black slash pine, cornstalk pine, longshucks pine, Indian pine, frankincense pine 1708 DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen, coniferous tree typically reaching 25-30 m in height but may reach up to 50 m. The crown is broadly conical and dense. USE: The timber is used for furniture, pulpwood, plywood, composite boards, posts, poles, pilings, crates, boxes, pallets. The tree is also planted to stabilize eroded or damaged soils. It can be used for shade or ornamental trees, as well as bark mulch. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Loblolly pine. FURTHER INF: The term ""loblolly"" literally means ""mudhole"" which can be used to describe the wet soil conditions on which this tree occurs naturally. Their best growth is on moderately acid soils in areas of poor surface drainage which consists of a thick, medium-textured surface layer and fine-textured subsoil. They do not grow well, however, on very wet or water-logged sites, or in areas with shallow or eroded soils. The tree grows best in moist sites, but it can grow in drier areas and compete with other pines. It is mostly found on Ultisol soils, although small areas of Entisols, Spodosols, and Alfisols are scattered throughout its range. Productivity is sensitive to soil fertility; if poorly drained soils have low fertility, usually there is a decrease in productivity. Also, the presence of a spodic horizon along the root zone causes a decline in productivity. This tree is planted on Histosols following artificial drainage and site preparation. It can be found at elevations from 1300 to 2700 m. The latitudinal range of natural occurrence is 28-39°N. The tree is frost resistant. Annual wood production potential is 12-30 m3/ha.

Leaves imparipinnate, shiny; young leaves pinkish red, mature leaves glossy, deep green; leaflets 5-9, the terminal leaflet larger than the others; stipels none; stipules caducous. Flowers fragrant, white to pinkish, paired along rachis in axillary, pendent, long racemes or panicles; calyx campanulate or cup-shaped, truncate, short-dentate, lowermost lobe sometimes longer; standard suborbicular, broad, usually with 2 inflexed, basal ears, thinly silky-haired outside; wings oblique, long, somewhat adherent to the obtuse keel; keel petals coherent at apex; stamens monadelphous, vexillary stamen free at the base but joined with others into a closed tube; ovary subsessile to short-stalked, pubescent; ovules 2, rarely 3; style filiform, upper half incurved, glabrous; stigma small, terminal. Pod short stalked, oblique-oblong, flat, smooth, thickly leathery to sub-woody, indehiscent, 1-seeded; seed thick, reniform. USES: As an ornamental in gardens and along avenues and roadsides, for its fragrant Wisteria-like flowers, and as a host plant for lac insects. Flowers are considered a good source of pollen for honeybees in India and they yield adequate nectar. With a calorific value of 4 600 kcal/kg, pongam is commonly used as a fuel wood. A preferred species for controlled soil erosion and binding sand dunes because of its extensive network of lateral roots. Incorporation of leaves and the press cake into soils improves fertility. The seeds contain pongam oil, a bitter, red brown, thick, non-drying, nonedible oil, 27-36% by weight, which is used for tanning leather, soap, as a liniment to treat scabies, herpes, and rheumatism and as an illuminating oil. The seed oil is under investigation as a renewable source of bio-diesel. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. FURTHER INF.: It is native to humid and sub-tropic environments and is common along waterways or seashores, with its roots in fresh or saltwater. It is reported as native to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand and exotic in Australia, China, Egypt, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tonga and the United States of America. It occurs naturally in lowland forest on limestone and rocky coral outcrops on the coast, along the edges of mangrove forest and along tidal streams and rivers. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 1200 m. In its natural habitat, the species tolerates a wide temperature range. Mature trees withstand light frost and temperatures of up to 50°C. Reported temperature range for growth is 10-50°C with the optimum between 16-38°C. It is drought resistant and well adapted to adverse climatic conditions; prolonged drought may however kill seedlings. Reported annual rainfall range for growth is 400-2500 mm with the optimum between 500-2000 mm. In addition to rain, trees require a dry season of 2-6 months. It is a shade bearer and can grow under the shade of other trees, it is, however, not a shade demander and grows well even with full overhead light. It is well adapted to adverse soil moisture conditions and waterlogging. It can grow on most soil types but best growth is found on deep well-drained sandy loams with assured moisture, it will however also grow on sandy soils and heavy swelling clay soils. It does not do well on dry sands. It is very tolerant of saline conditions and alkalinity. Reported soil pH range for growth is 6-9 with the optimum between 6.5-8.5. Nodulation is reported on pongam. In nurseries and fields the presence of nodules on un-inoculated pongam seedlings is common. Therefore, this species may not be specific in its Rhizobium strain requirement. It nodulates and fixes atmospheric nitrogen with Rhizobium of the cowpea group. Propagation methods: Natural reproduction is profuse by seed and common by root suckers. Spontaneous seedlings and root suckers are produced and may cause serious weed problems. Direct sowing is common and most successful. Seeds require no pre-treatment and germinate within 7 days to 1 month of sowing. Germination is hypogeal and the radicle develops quickly before the plumule emerges. In the nursery, it can be planted at a close spacing, as young plants tolerate shade well; in India a spacing of 7.5 x 15 cm is recommended. Seedlings attain a height of 25-30 cm in their first growing season. Transplanting to the field should occur at the beginning of the next rainy season when seedlings are about 60 cm in height. Seedlings have large root systems and soil should be retained around the roots during transplanting. Easily established by direct seeding or by planting nursery-raised seedlings or stump cuttings of 1-2 cm root-collar diameter. Propagation by branch cuttings and root suckers is also possible. Tree Management: Seedling survival and growth benefit from annual weed control for the first 3 years after transplanting. Growth of young trees is fairly slow; a growth of 1.3 m in height and 0.4 cm in diameter in 13 months was recorded in India. Trees coppice well and can also be pollarded. When planted as a shade or ornamental tree, pruning may be necessary to obtain a trunk of appropriate height. The spacing adopted in avenue planting is about 8 m between plants. In block plantings, the spacing can range from 2 x 2 m to 5 x 5 m. Individual trees yield 9-90 kg of pods annually, (8-24 kg of seeds). The lateral spread of roots on this species, about 9 m in 18 years, is greater than most other species; moreover it produces root suckers profusely. Because of these characteristics, pongam is usually unsuitable for agro-forestry and has the potential to become a weed if not managed carefully; it also attracts many pests and diseases.",http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=1781

The fruit is 3-8 cm in diameter, fleshy and yellow to red. USES  The fruit can be used fresh, canned, dried, or frozen. The tree is grown as an ornamental and mentioned as a useful agroforestry species. KILLING T  Opened flowers are killed by frosts and the tree may be killed at temperatures about -5°C. GROWING PERIOD  Perennial deciduous tree, that bear after 2-4 years and with an economic life of 8-12 years. Period per year about 300-330 days. COMMON NAMES  Peach, Nectarine, Brugnon, Pecher, Persik, Peras, Khai, Makmuan, Tho, Hung mon, Dao. FURTHER INF  Scientific synonym: Amygdalus persica, Persica vulgaris. Peach is native of Iran or China. It thrive best in areas with medium to low relative air humidity, but the trees must have continuous soil moisture during the growing season. Areas that regularly have late spring frosts are not suitable for peach production. The trees usually require 100-400 hours with temperatures less than 5-7°C to overcome the dormancy period, some varieties, however, require less winter chilling. It can be grown in tropical highlands in seasonal climate at elevations between 1200-2000 m and in the subtropics. The kernels are toxic. A bee population is needed for pollination. Humid conditions during the ripening of the fruit are undesirable because they favour the development of brown rot. Late frosts may kill flowers and summer rains may lead to diseases. Annual fruit yields may be between 10-25 t/ha. SOURCES (P. persica (L.) Batsch) Sims D (pers. comm.)

00fe6e4d-2c1a-4b1b-b6e8-20960eb7bfaa,Ricinus communis,"L. Magnoliopsida:Dilleniidae:Euphorbiales:Euphorbiaceae castor oil plant, bele ni vavalagi, lama papalagi, castor bean, gullo, kobo (Galinya), kasterolieboom 1866 DESCRIPTION: Castor in tropical countries is an erect herbaceous shrub or a small plant 6-10 m tall; its longevity is 8-12 years. In moderate climates this plant has a woody stem 0.5-4 m tall and it dies during autumn due to frosts or as a result of desiccation. The taproot penetrates the soil up to 1.5-3 m, or in the case of a crop of many years standing, up to 5-6 m. Most important are the secondary lateral roots that spread in the ploughed layer up to 1 m. If there is insufficient moisture the root grows deep, with little lateral spreading, whereupon their development leads to growth of the above ground mass. The stems are succulent, herbaceous, very variable in all aspects - 7.5-15 cm in diameter. Its stem is geniculate, thick, branching and terminates with a raceme spike. In some of the varieties grown in Russia, the stem has from 5 to 12 nodes and the same number of leaves at a 30-100 cm height of stem, and the length of the internode is 6-10 cm. The dwarf varieties have short (1.5-3 cm) internodes. The castor plant is well foliated. Leaves are glabrous and alternate on the basis of a 2/5 layout, except the first two opposite leaves. They are 10-16 cm wide, smooth, rarely wrinkled and have stipules at the base of their long (20-50 cm) glandular petioles. They are palmate - parted in 7-9 lanceolate dentate lobes - the middle one being the largest. It has monoecious flowers - male and female flowers are on the same plant and form clusters (racemes) 10-40 cm long in terminal pannicles. The tubular perianth is 5-lobed. They are numerous in long inflorescences, petals absent in both sexes (male and female flowers are apetalous), sepals 3-5, greenish; stamens numerous, 5-10 mm long; ovary superior, 3-celled with a short style and 3-6 stigmas. The upper fruit syncarp is a spherical or elongated dehiscent, fragile 3-sectioned dry capsule 2.5 cm in diameter, 1-3.5 cm long with a wrinkled or smooth surface. It is borne on an elongated pedicel, and is often spiny. The colour of the ripening capsules is green, yellow, brown, red, crimson or violet; dried ones are often grey or brown. The seed of castor is nut-oval, tick-like, egg-shaped, rarely spherical or elongated in form, 0.8-3 cm long, 0.6-1.5 cm wide and 0.4-1.0 cm thick. It is carunculate. The seeds are covered by a dense, shiny but fragile hull of two colours. The background is dark, usually dark-gray, red or brown, rarely black or white; there are mosaic spots of various dimensions and colors; pink, white-brown, red, black. The pattern varying from fine to coarse, veined or finely dotted to large splotches. The integument and cotyledons are flat and slender. There are 1,000 to 11,000 seeds per kg; commercial varieties having 2,200 to 3,200 per kg. It is a C3 pathway plant but with restricted assimilation of CO . USES: The seeds yield a water-resistant fast-drying, non-yellowing oil, used mainly in industry and medicines. The oil is included in fuel mixtures for precision engines. Dehydrated oil is an excellent drying agent that compares favourably with tung oil and is used in paints and varnishes and as a basic ingredient in emollient soaps. It is used in coating fabrics and other protective coverings, in the manufacture of high-grade lubricants, transparent typewriter and printing inks, in textile dyeing (when converted into sulphonated castor oil or turkey-red oil, for dyeing cotton fabrics with alizarine) and in leather preservation. It is also used for plastics, ointments, and cosmetics. The seed has purgative and emollient properties and administration is as oil, capsules, enema, ointment and suppositories. Pharmacological compounds to combat hair-loss usually contain castor oil and it has an antidandruff effect. The expressed oil cakes are used as fertilizer and detoxified meal can be fed to livestock; although it is highly toxic due to its ricin (that has been used as a poison), a method of detoxicating the meal has now been found, so that it can safely be fed to livestock. Plant stems are made into paper and wallboard. NB.: The seeds must never be swallowed: 5-6 will kill a child, 10 will kill an adult - there is no specific antidote. KILLING T.: During the rest period it is -2 C. It does not tolerate low temperatures during the growing period. GROWING PERIOD: Grown as an annual in temperate regions, and as a short-lived perennial under subtropical and tropical conditions. Growing period is 140-160 days for early cultivars, and 170-210 days for late cultivars. COMMON NAMES: Castor, Castorbean, Ricin, Ricino. FURTHER INF.: The name Ricinus is a Latin word for tick; the seed is so named because it has markings and a bump at the end, that resemble certain ticks. Castor perform best with a relative humidity of 30-60 %, ideally humidity should be higher during vegetative growth and lower during the period of maturity and harvest. To high humidity can lead to increased insect problems. Castor can be cultivated between 40°S and 52°N and it can be grown from sea-level up to 1500-3000 m in elevation, but it is best grown between 300-1800 m. The photosynthesis pathway C3 II. The species is most probably indigenous to North-East Africa, especially Ethiopia. 1 ton of seed remove about 30 kg N, 5 kg P, 12 kg K, and 4 kg Ca, and 3 kg Mg from the field. Unbalanced N-fertilizer encourages the growth of foliage at the expense of seed formation. The global average yield is 0.75 t/ha, in Africa 0.5 t/ha but in the United States 3.0 t/ha are not exceptional under irrigation. The seeds of the plant are poisonous, eating a single seed may cause serious illness and the leaves should not be used as forage. Sims D (pers. comm.)

Liliopsida:Commelinidae:Cyperales:Gramineae sugarcane, sugar cane, canna da zucchero, caña de azúcar, cana de acucar, Zuckerrohr, suikerriet, shenkora, dovu, dovu buta, dovu vico, malaqele, kabakabavale, ganna, te kaikawewe (Kiribati), to, tolo (Samoa, Tuvalu), peqi (Simbo), suti (Roviana), suga 1884 DESCRIPTION: The sugar cane plant is a large perennial tropical grass with thick stems that may grow up to 2-3 meters tall, but with extended growing periods it can become much taller. The roots of the cane plant develop from the growth ring on the original planting piece and also from the new shoots that develop. The majority of the roots are thin and superficial with four fifths of the roots commonly found in the top 25-50 cm. Thicker roots will penetrate to depths of four meters or more. The stem of sugarcane is economically the most important plant part. The stems are made up of nodal units, which include the node and the internode. The internal part of the stem is largely parenchyma interspersed with vascular bundles. The parenchyma cells accumulate sugar. Each node subtends a leaf with an axillary bud at the base of the leaf sheath. The individual shoots of sugarcane show strong apical dominance; however, when this is broken the axillary buds develop into new shoots. Contrary to most grasses, the stem is not hollow but filled, as in maize and sorghum. In a magnified cross section it presents the typical aspect of a monocotyledon. Inside the rind tissue and within the vascular bundle is the delicate parenchyma that contains the sucrose-rich plasma. The leaves of sugarcane are distributed alternately on the stem and comprise the leaf sheath and the leaf blade or lamina. The leaf sheath wraps closely round the stem and in some varieties clings to the stem long after the leaf blade and the sheath have senesced. On some varieties the sheath ruptures naturally where it joins the node and the leaves fall naturally. Leaves and sheaths of some varieties are covered with a large number of siliceous hairs. These hairs penetrate the skin of cane cutters and are most unpleasant; hence cane cutters prefer varieties with few hairs or burnt cane. The terminal meristem of the cane shoot turns reproductive about 3 months before the emergence of the flower. The flowers of cane are of no commercial significance per se, and many varietal selection programs are directed towards the elimination of flowering in commercial fields. Flowering is, however, of great importance in breeding programs, many of which use artificial methods to stimulate flowering. USES: It provides raw sugar. Important by-products are bagasse, molasses, filter mud cakes, and cane wax. Bagasse is residue used as fuel, livestock feed, and for the manufacture of fiberboard, paper pulp, plastic, furfural, and cellulose. Molasses are fed to livestock, used for industrial purposes, in confectionary, and it is the source of industrial alcohol as well as rum and gin. Filter mud cakes are used as fertilizer. Cane wax is used in the production of furniture, shoe, and leather polishes, electrical insulating material, and waxed paper. Brazil is a major grower of sugarcane, which is used to produce sugar and provide the ethanol used in making gasoline-ethanol blends (gasohol) for transportation fuel. KILLING T.: Seedlings may not tolerate -7 to -12°C, and the mature plant not -2°C. Long-term exposure to temperatures below 10°C may also be lethal. When temperatures reach 0°C leaves become chlorotic, at about -3°C young plants turn brown and the terminal buds and leaves of mature cane die, at -5.5°C the millable stem dies. When the temperature reaches -11.5°C the whole plant dies in susceptible clones. There are large varietal differences in cold tolerance and susceptibility to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, growing from 7-24 months, usually 14-18 months, with an additional 12 months for the ratoon crop. It is normally grown as a perennial crop in which several ratoons are taken. COMMON NAMES: Sugarcane, Nobel cane, Canne a sucre, Cana de azucar, Zuckerrohr. FURTHER INF.: For ripening relative low temperatures in the range of 10-20°C and dry weather are desirable. Sugarcane is photoperiod sensitive. Flowering is induced by a continuous reduction in day length of as little as 1 minute per day from long days of about 13 hours. Most commercial sugarcane is grown between 35°N and S in the tropics usually at altitudes from sea level to 1600 m. Nobel canes are native to islands in the South Pacific, most probably New Guinea. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III. Cane us is considered to be moderately tolerant to saline soil conditions; electrical conductivity of the soil solution should be less than 2 d S m-1 with a threshold value of 4 d S m-1. In Khuzestan, Iran, cane is grown on soils which have been desalinated from an EC of 30 to 3 dS/m-1. Cane is relatively tolerant of acid soils with large areas of cane in Latin America grown on the acid oxisols and utisols. It prefers moderate to high humidity and high winds cause damage and lower yields. Where sugarcane is grown under irrigation in Africa, a yield of 100-150 tons of cane/ha is obtained from the plant crop and 60-90 tons from the first ratoon crop. Under rain-fed conditions, about half of the above mentioned yield is obtained. Sugarcane is grown on over 20 million ha with an average yield of 64 t/ha to produce a total of 1,25 million t of cane. This is equivalent to about 130 million t of sugar if all the cane were used to produce sugar in moderately efficient factories. Centrifuged sugar production from cane is much less, as large quantities of cane are used to produce alcohol, particularly in Brazil as a liquid fuel. Sims D (pers. comm.)

Leaves alternate, imparipinnate, short-stalked, 10-30 cm long, 5-15 cm wide, the leaflets opposite or alternate, very unequal in size and shape, the larger often petiolulate, ovate to ovate-oblong, enequilateral, apically acuminate to acute, basally subcordate, 2-10 cm long, 1-6 cm wide, the smaller more blunt apically, more cordate basally, broadly ovate to orbicular, 2ˆ15 mm in diameter, thinly to densely pubescent. Flowers white or blue, pedunculate in lateral, many flowered cymes, the hairy peduncle 5-15 cm long, the jointed hairy pedicels 3-35 mm long. Calyx campanulate, 5-lobate, 1.5-2 cm in diameter, the lobes acute or acuminate. Corolla twice as long as calyx, 3.5-4 cm in diameter. Anthers free, erect, poricidal, yellow. Fruit a globose 2-celled berry, many-seeded, yellowish green. The tubers are mostly located within the top 25 cm of the soil. USES: It is cultivated for its edible tubers. Tubers are one of the temperate staples, eaten boiled, baked, fried, stewed, candied with syrup, or pureed and they are processed into fried chips, starch, flour, glucose, and alcohol and they can be canned or dehydrated etc. Surplus potatoes are used for fodder and alcohol, and chemurgic applications. The flour can be used for baking. Potato starch is used to determine the diastatic value of starch. Boiled with weak sulphuric acid, potato starch is changed into glucose and fermented into alcohol. It is estimated that potatoes would give 104 liters ethanol per ton of production. Rotten potatoes and the waste in the potato chip industry can be converted to butanol with a greater energy content than ethanol. Twenty percent butanol can be added to regular gas and up to 40% to diesel as extenders without engine modification. Ripe potato juice is excellent for cleaning cottons, silks, and woolens. Root and leaf diffusates of growing potato plants possess cardiotonic activity. Dried ethanol extracts of above-ground parts show marked hypotensive and myotropic action and a spasmolytic and soothing effect on intestinal musculature. Ethanol extracts of leaves have antifungal properties, active against Phytophthora infestans. Leaves, seeds, and tuber extracts show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The tubers contain 8-28% starch and 1-4% protein. KILLING T.: -1 C. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial, grown as an annual, growing 90-160 days. COMMON NAMES: Potato, spud, Irish potato, English potato, pomme de terre, papa, patata, kartoffel, aardappel, alv, watalu, kentang, yang shu, shue tsai, viazi, poni, turma, batata, aardappel, bareisko, jyagaima, ganja, alu, toru, cartoful, hardoppel. FURTHER INF.: The green parts of the potato plant contain toxins. Flowers are common but fruits are only set in cool climates or under a day length of 16-17 hours. The fruits are berries, similar to small tomatoes. Ranging from Boreal Moist to Wet through Tropical Very Dry to Wet Forest Life Zones, potato is reported to tolerate annual precipitations of 900 to 4100 mm, annual temperatures of 3.6 to 27.8 C and a pH of 4.2 to 8.2. Potatoes are a cool weather crop, the optimal temperature for growth being 15-20 C for most cvs. Growth of tubers is best at a soil temperature of 17-20 C, with usually no tubers formed above 32 C. They perform well on a wide variety of soils, sandy loams, silt loams, loams, and peats. Soil moisture tensions between 40 and 60 centibars seem to produce the best yields. The species is native to the Andean mountains between 10 N and 20 S. The latitudinal range is 60 N to 40 S. In the tropics, potato can be grown at altitude between 400-2500 m.

It has fibrous, spreading roots and consists of a primary, secondary and supporting roots. The primary root is developed from the seed embryo. It is the only embryo root produced by the seed during germination. Before the production of secondary roots, the primary root is the main organ by which the plant absorbs nutrients and moisture from the soil. Prop roots may grow from culm nodes. There is a bud at each node from which a tiller may grow. The only temporary root in sorghum is the single radicle of the germinating seedling. Mature roots of sorghum are all adventitious. Those permanent roots have numerous branched lateral roots interlacing the soil in all directions. The system may extend to at least 1.5 m away from the plant, and is most abundant in the top 90 cm, although it may extend to twice that depth. One of the important factors affecting water use and drought endurance must be the effectiveness of the root system. While the primary roots of maize and sorghum are equally extensive, sorghum possesses twice as many secondary roots as maize at any one stage of growth. After the plant produces 3-4 leaves, secondary roots grow out from the base of the stalk node near the soil surface. The stalk has about 10-20 clearly protruding nodes and a leaf is produced from every node. Leaves (30-135 cm long and 6-13 cm wide) are opposite-decussate and consist of the sheath, blade and tongue or ligule. The sheath is very long and adheres closely to a major part of the internode. The blade is broad, strap-like, dentate and the surface is smooth and covered with a waxy powder which plays a role in reducing evaporation. In dry conditions, the leaf blade will roll up into a tube, reducing the exposed area and thus cutting down the loss of moisture. Flowers are grouped in an apical panicle formed by several reddish spikelets. The grain is an oblong caryopsis; which consists of the seed coat, testa, endosperm and embryo. The shapes and colours of seeds are very varied and are covered by glumes and there are round, flat-round, oval, ellipse shapes etc. The colours include white, light yellow, pink, brown, red-brown, dark brown etc. In general, the seed of sweet sorghum is smaller than that of grain sorghum; the thousand-seed weight is about 21g varying between 16-28g. (25,000 to 61,740/kg for sweet and grain sorghum; 120,000 to 159,000/kg for grass sorghum). USES: The versatility of sweet sorghum resulted in Prof. Li Dajue (of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Peter Griffee (FAO) coining the name the ""Four F's Crop"" for sweet sorghum in 1997 at the first International Sweet Sorghum Conference. The ""Four Fs"" represent the four potential outputs from sweet sorghum, namely: Food, Fuel, Fodder, & Fibre. In Asia, R&D has concentrated on maximizing all four outputs to produce the 'multi-purpose' varieties, whilst in Europe, the potential use of sweet sorghum as a sugar producer for fuel ethanol production has driven the current direction of R&D towards liquid bio-fuel production. In southern Africa, the potential for using sweet sorghum for energy and crystalline sugar production is being explored. A disadvantage is that the stems have to be processed within a matter of hours after harvest. However, new technology is emerging for in-field juice extraction and storage to extend the factory processing period. The grain can be ground into flour, some cultivars can be used as popcorn and the grain can be manufactured into beer. Stems are used for thatching, fencing, brushes, and basketry. A dye can be extracted. Grain and straw can be fed to livestock and embryos yield an oil used in cooking and salad oils. The inflorescence has astringent, haemostatic and antidiarrhoeic properties and administration is as infusion, tincture and medicinal wine. GROWING PERIOD: Annual or short-term perennial grass. Most sorghum plants take 90-120 days to mature, the boot stage is reached in 50-60 days, flowering in 60-70 days and full grain maturity in 90-120 days. COMMON NAMES: Sorghum, Sorgho, Sorgo, Great millet, Milo, Jowar, Cholam, Guinea corn, Durra, Mtama, Jowal, Jolar, Cholam, Koaliang. FURTHER INF.: Lowland tropical sorghums are adapted to warm days and night temperatures above 22°C throughout the growing season. The poisonous glucocide 'dhurrin' in sorghum is present from germination, increasing to a maximum and then disappearing as the grain develops, so that in the later stages the plants is safe as fodder. New long day varieties exist. The photosynthesis pathway C4III. The species is probably indigenous to North-East Africa, north of latitude 10°N and east of longitude 25°E. Sorghum is grown between 40°N and S. Sweet sorghum can be found at elevations between sea level and 1500 m, most East African sorghum is grown between the altitudes of 900-1500 m, and cool-tolerant varieties are grown between 1600 and 2500 m. The nutrient removal for 1 ton of grain is about 50 kg N, 9 kg P, and 45 kg K, calculated from the above-ground plant mass. Grain yields of up to 4 t/ha can be obtained, but in the driest areas, the yield usually varies between 0.3-1.2 t/ha, and the global average is about 1.3 t/ha. Like the common grain sorghum, sweet sorghum can produce grain yields of 1500-7500 kg/ha. But the essence of sweet sorghum is not from its seed, but from its stalk; which contains sugar. In general, the stalk yield is 45000-75000 kg/ha. The sugar content in the juice of sweet sorghum varies in different varieties. It's Brix ranges generally from between 15-23%. Genetic resources: There is a wide varaition in seed type from Beijing Botanical Garden's sweet sorghum germplasm collection. ICRISAT is involved in diversification of sorghum breeding populations, and ultimately cultivars available to farmers, through the incorporation of traits and genetic materials that have not previously been used in crop improvement. For example, new random-mating populations have been produced using diverse germplasm selected for resistance to head and stem pests, earliness with high grain and biomass yield, tillering ability, large grain and resistance to grain molds. ICRISAT initiated a program for the identification and development of sweet-stalked and high-biomass sorghum hybrid parents and varieties in 2002. Promising lines such as ICSB 631 and ICSB 264 among the seed parents; and Seredo, ICSR 93034, S 35, ICSV 700, ICSV 93046, E 36-1, NTJ 2 and Entry 64 DTN among the varieties/male parents were identified for their high stalk sugar content. The sugar percentage in these seed parents and varieties ranged from 16.8% to 21.6%. Four of these lines, S 35, ICSV 700, ICSR 93034 and Entry 64 DTN are being evaluated in the All India Coordinated Sorghum Improvement Program (AICSIP). A Special/Sweet Sorghum Hybrid (SSH) 104 developed from ICSA 38, an ICRISAT-bred male-sterile (seed) parent and SSV 84, a male parent bred in India is being recommended for release for commercial cultivation. The national sorghum program, through extensive testing in AICSIP, released a sweet-stalk sorghum variety SSV 84 in 1992/93 for general cultivation. The wide variability available in germplasm and hybrid parents for the traits related to ethanol production such as percentage of sugar, sucrose and Brix (a measure for sugar content in liquids) and high stalk yield offers bright scope for the development of high stalk yielding sugar-rich varieties and hybrids. The EMBRAPA National Centre of Maize and Sorghum Research in Brazil has also developed new sweet sorghum varieties and work closely with ICRISAT. Sims D (pers. comm.)

b5d29378-c749-45c3-8226-f62db8405ad2,Theobroma cacao,"L. Magnoliopsida:Dilleniidae:Malvales:Sterculiaceae cocoa, cacao, koko, Kakao 2074 DESCRIPTION: A small semi-deciduous cauliflorous tree 5-10 m high with a foliage canopy of 4-5 m in diameter when about 10 years old. When fully developed the taproot is 0.8-2 m deep. Lateral roots arise along its entire length but only develop to any great extent in the upper portion, usually from the collar to 15-20 cm down. Up to 10 branched lateral roots may develop in the topsoil covering a 5-6 m radius and with a mass of root hairs. The main trunk is short; branches in whorls of 5, dimorphic; vertical chupons growing from the trunk have leaves arranged in 5/8 phyllotaxy. The lateral branches (fans) have 1/2 phyllotaxy. Stems initially develop orthotropically then in successive elongation phases up to 18 months with a 1-1.5 m trunk. Further growth is interrupted by the degeneration of the terminal bud, below which the first 3-5 branch meristems develop simultaneously, in the form of a whorl growing horizontally. These fan branches form the framework of the tree and are refereed to as a 'jorquette'. The young leaves, which appear either as the trunk develops or during the flushes, are very often pigmented. They appear in accordance with a 3/8 phyllotaxy arrangement. Their colour may vary, depending on the tree type, from pale green, to pink, to deep purple. The young leaves are limp and pendant; as they mature, they become dark green and rigid. The leaves are coriaceous or chartaceous, alternate, and distichous on normal branches. The petiole has 2 joined pulvini, one at the base and the other at the point of insertion of the leaf. Stipules 2, deciduous. Lamina elliptical-oblong or obovate-oblong, simple, 10-45 cm long; generally smooth, sometimes hairy, rounded and obtuse at the base, pointed apex. The inflorescence is dichasial; primary peduncle very short, often thick and lignified. Flower peduncle 1-4 cm long. Sepals 5, triangular, whitish or reddish in colour. Petals 5, joined at the base into a cuplike structure, whitish-yellow with dark purple bands adaxially; ligules spathulate, yellowish. Stamens 5, fertile, alternating with 5 staminodes, the 2 whorls uniting to form a tube. Anthers 2, stamens fused. Ovary superior with a single style terminating in 5 sticky stigmatic surfaces. The fruit is 10-15 cm long and yellow or purplish and is variable in shape, ovoid, oblong; sometimes pointed and constricted at the base or almost spherical, with 10 furrows of which 5 are prominent. Axial placentation, the seeds (embedded in mucilage) flat or round with white or purple cotyledons. The fruit is attached to the branch or trunk by a woody stalk which was originally the stalk of the flower but which thickens as the pod develops. The pericarp or cortex of the pod consists of three distinct layers; the hairy and thick epicarp, which is more or less hard (the epidermis of which may be pigmented); the mesocarp, which is thin and hard and more or less woody; and the hairy endocarp, which is of varying thickness. Pods generally contain an average of thirty to forty seeds, an estimate which is convenient for a rough evaluation of yield in the plantation. However, the number of seeds per pod varies enormously. The cocoa seed or fresh bean is shaped rather like a plump almond, and is surrounded by a white mucilaginous pulp; which is both sweet and rather sour. The average dimensions of the seed are 20-30 mm in length, 12-16 wide and 7-12 thick. Cocoa seeds readily germinate when sown and do not pass through a dormancy period. They lose viability within 5-7 days of extraction from the pod unless specially treated, and germinate within 7-10 days. The plant can easily be propagated vegetatively by leaf-bud cutting, multiple-bud cutting, marcotting, budding, grafting and layering. USES: Food: The cocoa bean, with up to 50% fat, is a valuable source of vegetable fat: cocoa butter. The residual cocoa powder is used in cakes, biscuits, chocolate, drinking chocolate and other confectioneries. Fodder: The cocoa-pod husk has a low alkaloid content, while tannin is practically absent and husks are used as stock feed. The crude fibre content is low; it is completely unlignified and compares favourably with and . Fuel: The cocoa bean testa has a calorific value of 16 000-19 000 BTU/kg, a little higher than that for wood. Lipids: The ash from pod husks contains potassium oxide, which can be extracted in the form of potassium hydroxide, a useful alkaline in the saponification process. Cocoa-bean fat from unfermented cocoa beans can be extracted and used in soap making. Alcohol: The cocoa-pod husk can be hydrolysed under pressure for fermentation into alcoholic drinks. Medicine: Cacao butter can be used in cosmetics and has medical properties. The rural people in Amazonas State, Brazil, rub cocoa butter on bruises. Soil improver: There is considerable nutrient cycling through the development of a deep leaf litter under the cocoa canopy. Intercropping: Cocoa has traditionally been established in thinned forest following logging and 1-3 years of food-crop production before the canopy closes. Crops such as maize, cocoyam, yams and plantain are commonly intercropped with cocoa in Ecuador, Jamaica and West Africa. KILLING T.: Temperatures of about 5 C, even for a short period, may damage cacao but it is grown in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where normal winter temperatures reach 4-6 C. The tree is damaged by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial tree, that begins fruiting after 3-5 years and bears well up to an age of 30-40 years, or even 60 years in the best soils before yields begin to decline. Fruit and seed require 180-300 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: (Burmese): kokoe, (English): cacao, chocolate tree, cocoa, Nicaraguan cocoa shade, (French): cacao, cacaotier, cacaoyer, (German): Kakaobaum, (Indonesian): coklat, (Khmer): kakaaw, (Malay): pokok coklat, (Sinhala): maikona gaha, (Spanish): cacao amarillo, cacao criollo, cacao forastero, (Tamil): kona maram, (Thai): kho kho. FURTHER INF.: The generic name comes from the Greek ?theos? (god), and ?broma? (food) and means the ?food of the gods?. In its natural habitat it is an under-storey plant of forest in the wet humid tropics. In most of the producing countries of America, Asia or Oceania, permanent shading is provided by specially-planted trees, most commonly , , various Erythrinae or even Albizia species. Finally, other industrial crops are often used as permanent shading for the cocoa tree, the coconut palm in particular. Of other crops there have been several attempts to intercrop cocoa trees with rubber, oil palm, areca palm ( ) or even with nutmeg ( ). When planted at their normal density, all these plants produce too much shade for the cocoa trees, which develop as far as vegetation is concerned, but produce very few pods. Cacao originated in the Upper Amazon region in South America. It can be grown between 20°N and S, but the bulk of the crop is grown within 10°N and S, usually below 300 m in elevation but it can be found up to 700 m, and exceptionally up to 1500 m in equatorial regions. The photosynthesis pathway is C3. Cacao is best adapted to 75-86% relative humidity at 09.0 hours, and 51-72% at 15.0 hours, above this humidity level the risk of diseases is increased. Young seedlings have a shade requirement for optimal growth, but for the mature crop optimal yield can only be obtained under full sunlight. Situations where the temperature frequently falls below 18.8 C, or rises above 32.2 C are said to be unfavourable. Cacao is sensitive to strong winds. The amount of nutrients removed in the harvest is not very high if the fruit shells are brought back to the plantation and used as mulch. One ton of cacao beans remove about 20 kg N, 4 kg P, and 10 kg K from the field. Optimum yield of dry beans is more than 2.0 t/ha, while average yields in Africa vary between 0.2-1.0 t/ha. It takes 16-30 kg of pods to produce 1 kg of dry cacao. Cacao is naturally out-breeding, and various insects are associated with its pollination, the main ones being thrips, midges, ants and aphids. It has a complex system of self-incompatibility. After successful pollination, fertilization takes place within 36 hours; the sepals, petals and staminodes drop away and the stamens and pistil wither. The young pod, known as the cherelle, begins to develop by longitudinal elongation, followed by increase in width. The period between fertilization and pod maturation varies from 150 to 180 days, depending on the variety. The pod turns light yellow when ripe and is ready for harvesting at this stage. Fermented seeds are roasted, cracked and ground to give a powdery mass from which fat is expressed. Cacao has the distinction of being a birthplace of IPM and over the last 30 years cocoa has increasingly become a smallholder cash crop. An estimated 80% of the world's cocoa is now produced by smallholders. Sims D (pers. comm.)

The roots of the wheat plant may be divided into two groups, namely, the seminal roots, or those belonging initially to the embryo, or which develop later from the hypocotyl or near it, and the adventitious roots, which spring from the nodes of the plant, within the soil or just above it. The terminal four to seven internodes of the shoot elongate to form the flowering stem or culm and internode elongation is complete by the time of anthesis. Internodes increase in final length from the base of the culm to the uppermost internode, which carries the ear, the peduncle. The basal internodes are shorter than the enclosing sheath of the subtending leaf, while the peduncle and the penultimate internode are longer than enclosing sheaths, revealing a length of bare stem and carrying the emerged ear clear of the sheath. Sometimes in environmentally stressful conditions internode elongation is restricted and the ear remains partially enclosed in the flag leaf sheath. The strong, thickened sheaths of the culm leaves are structurally important for stem strength and stiffness and the knot or pulvinus is instrumental in carrying the ear aloft if the plant is lodged. The leaf is divided at the ligule into a cylindrical sheath and the flat blade or lamina. The sheath is tubular at the base but nearer to the blade it is split with the margins overlapping. The lamina has a fairly well marked midrib, along which runs the major vascular bundle of the leaf. It divides the blade into two sub-equal parts, each of which has a number of parallel lateral ribs or veins. Each vein marks the position of a vascular bundle and the tissue over the bundle is raised producing a ridge, so that the adaxial surface of the blade is corrugated. The abaxial surface is more or less flat. The midrib extends down into the sheath for a short distance as a pronounced ridge. The leaf blade naturally assumes a twist and just below the tip, usually about two-thirds along the leaf there is frequently a constriction. This constriction is produced by the constraint upon growth produced by the closely investing ligule of the subtending leaf during development. The ligule is a thin colourless flap of tissue about 1-2 mm in length, which encircles the leaf or the culm above it beyond where the blade diverges. Associated with the ligule are the auricles, two small ear like projections fringed with unicellular hairs. At the base of the leaf sheath of the culm leaves there is a thicker zone, called variously the joint knot or pulvinus. It is considerably thicker and generally lighter green than the sheath above or the stem below. The node of the stem is below the joint and its position is marked by a slight constriction of the stem. The joint has an important function lifting the ear of a lodged stem off the ground and restoring it to a more or less vertical position. Leaf shape and size change with leaf position. The lowermost leaf on the main shoot has parallel sides to within 1 cm or so of the tip so that the tip itself is characteristically blunt. The leaves above the first have more or less parallel sides for about two-thirds their length above which they taper to a sharp point. The last leaf produced upon the culm, the flag leaf, tapers from about the lower third giving the leaf an elongated ovate shape. In spring wheat lamina length increases with increasing leaf number from the base, reaching a maximum one or two leaves before the flag leaf after which the length declines so the flag leaf is somewhat shorter than the longest leaf. Lamina width increases with leaf position so that the flag leaf is the widest leaf. Sheath length also increases with leaf position, markedly so for the culm leaves. Winter wheat shows comparable size changes, but associated with the long vegetative period the first-produced leaves show little change. Heteroblastic development is also seen in some anatomical features of the leaf. In the inflorescence each spikelet comprises an axis, the rachilla, which bears two glumes and a number of florets. Within each spikelet there are usually from two to four potentially fertile florets. The caryopsis is a dry indehiscent fruit. The dorsal side (with respect to the spikelet axis) is smoothly rounded while the ventral side has the deep crease. The embryo or germ is situated at the point of attachment of the spikelet axis and the distal end has a brush of fine hairs. The embryo is made up of the scutellum, the plumule and the radicle. The scutellum is the region that secretes some of the enzymes involved in germination and absorbs the soluble sugars from the breakdown of starch in the endosperm. The pollen grain, which has a life span of about 5 hours, when settled on a stigma germinates in about 1.5 hours to produce a pollen tube. This grows down the style, between the cells, and eventually reaches and enters the embryo sac via the micropyle. Wheat is a self-pollinating crop with a very low percentage of cross-pollination - from 1-4%. USES: Wheat is one of the most important food plants of man. It enters into international trade more than any other food. The economic stability of many nations is affected by the exchange in wheat. Wheat is utilized mainly as flour (whole grain or refined) for the production of a large variety of leavened and flat breads, and for the manufacture of a wide variety of other baking products such as biscuits, and confectionary. Fermented grains are made into various alcoholic drinks and industrial alcohol. Starch is used as cloth-stiffeners. Straws are fed to livestock, used for animal bedding and used in basketry and woven products. According to the phytomass files, annual productivity ranges from 4 to 18 MT/ha. Chaff is estimated to constitute 25% of the grain. Wheat straw is calculated at 1/2-2 times grain yield, more frequently, 1-1/2 times. However, in some countries, wheat biomass averages more than 6 MT/ha, double this if double cropped. The highest phytomass figure is 18 MT/ha/yr. The seeds are used in folk remedies for cancers, corns, tumors, warts, and whitlow. Reported to be antivinous, bilious, demulcent, discutient, diuretic, emollient, excipient, intoxicant, laxative, useful as a poultice, restorative, sedative, used as a shampoo and vulnerary, common wheat is a folk remedy for burns, cancer, diarrhea, dysentery, ecchymosis, epistaxis, fertility, fever, flux, gravel, hematuria, hemoptysis, hemorrhage, incontinence, leprosy, leucorrhea, menorrhagia, neurasthenia, night sweat, perspiration, scald, tumor, warts, whitlow, and wounds. KILLING T.: Winter wheat may withstand -20°C in the early and dormant stages, later it is like spring wheat and is sensitive to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Some cultivars of wheat are winter annual (winter wheat) and are sown in the autumn others are annual and sown in the spring (spring wheat). Normally the severity of the winter determines whether winter or spring types are grown. If winters are severe spring types are used, if winters are less cold, winter cultivars are grown. Sown in the autumn it may be harvested after 180-250 days, sown in the spring it may require 90-130 days. COMMON NAMES: Common wheat, wheat, bread wheat, blé, trigo, weizen. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: T. cereale Schrank, Baier., T. hybernum L., T. sativum Lam., T. vulgare. Wheat is grown from the tropics to 60 N and 40 S. In temperate regions and in the subtropics it can be grown at altitudes from sea level to 3000 m, in the tropics between 1500-3700 m or where suitable conditions exist in the lowlands. In the tropics and subtropics, it is grown only during the winter season. Principal wheat-growing areas of the world have similar growing conditions: the Russian prairies, the fertile pampas of Argentina, the Wheat belt of United States, all have fertile dark soils rich in nitrogen; rather hot, cloudless summers; rainfall which, although low, is well-distributed. A good wheat soil has physical structure, which holds together, making good water retention and favorable conditions for nitrate formation. Hot, humid conditions are unfavorable for wheat growing. Wheat prefers a low humidity of about 10%; high humidity encourages disease infestation, especially in combination with high temperatures. The photosynthesis pathway is C 3:1. The production of one ton of wheat removes 20-30 kg N, 6-8 kg P, and 20-28 kg K from the field; this includes the mineral contents in the grain plus the straw. The optimum yield of grain in temperate regions is 6.3 t/ha; the optimum yield in the tropics is 2.5 t/ha, while the average yield in Africa is 1.5 t/ha. Sims D (pers. comm.)

FURTHER INF  Broad bean is a major grain legume in northern Europe, it is probably native to the Mediterranean region or southwestern Asia. It can be grown in the tropics as a winter crop or at high elevation but most cultivars are not adapted to low evaluation and pods are rarely produced here. In the tropics altitudes of between 1200-2500 m with a diurnal variation in temperature are preferable. Average yields of dry beans are in UK, winter beans, 3.1-4.37 t/ha, spring beans, 2.5-3.75 t/ha, Peru, 1.5-2.25 t/ha and Marocco 1.1-1.6 t/ha. Experimental yields of more than 7.0 t have been reported. Yields of fresh green pods vary from 11.25-12.5 t/ha and 25 t/ha have been reported. The plant can reach a height of 0.6-2.0 m.

Erect and bushy to prostrate and creeping growth habits exist depending on cultivar and growing conditions. Cowpeas develop strong root systems that have many spreading laterals in the surface soil. The stems have circular sections and are pock marked. They are sometimes slightly grooved and are glabrous. The texture is fibrous and hard, firm and not inflated when young. Leaves are alternate and trifoliolate and the leaflets are oval, pointed (6-15 cm x 4-11 cm). They are generally entire and sometimes lobed. Genotypes vary in the degree of pubescence, but all cultivated cowpeas are less glabrous than other legumes such as common bean and soybean. Stipules are spurred at the base, stipels are hardly visible. Inflorescence racemose, flowers white, cream, yellow, mauve or purple. Pods usually occur in pairs forming a V, and are non-dehiscent. Pod orientation is mostly pendant and vertical. Pod length ranges from 6.5-25 cm and the width ranges from 3-12 mm. Under warm conditions, pod development is rapid and may take only two weeks from pollination to pod maturation. Each pod holds from 8 to 20 seeds in a crowded orientation. Seed length is between 6-11 mm and the width is from 4-9 mm. The testa colour also varies from white, pinky-white, pink, tan, brown, and black. The hylum is often ringed black or brown, strongly contrasting with the shade of the testa and hence the name ""blackeyed beans"" of the Antilles. The testa is thick and of ellipsoid and more or less rounded form. Number of seeds per kg is from 4600 up to 16000. USES: Cowpea is one of the most important grain legumes in Africa and in parts of the Americas and Asia. In addition to its dry grain, fresh-shelled 'peas', fresh pods, and fresh and dried leaves and flowers are consumed in some regions. The plant is used as cut and carry forage, and for hay and silage. Cowpea forms highly effective associations with a wide range of native nitrogen fixing strains of Rhizobium bacteria and with mycorrhizae that allows the species to tolerate poor soils. Used as a green manure, it can be incorporated into the soil 8-10 weeks after sowing, and can provide the equivalent of 80 kg/ha N to a subsequent crop. KILLING T.: It is susceptible to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. Some cowpea accessions may start flowering 30 days after sowing and are ready for harvest of dry seeds 25 days later; others may take more than 90 days to flower, and 210-240 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: Cowpea, crowder pea, clack-eyed pea, couthern pea, atimbawini, boeme, boontjie, catjang, caupí, frijol de vaca, imbumba, isihlumaya. FURTHER INF.: It is native of West Africa and cultivated throughout the tropics and subtropics between 40ºN and 30ºS at elevations between sea level and 2000 m. Occurs in areas with annual rainfall between 400-2000 mm and summer temperatures between 25-35°C. Found on a wide range of very acid (pH 4) to strongly alkaline also low-fertility soils from sands to heavy, well-drained clays, with a preference for lighter soils. It does not tolerate extended flooding or salinity. Most cowpea accessions exhibit classic short-day responses with respect to time of flowering, although a range of sensitivities occur and the effect is modulated by temperature. It is mainly autogamous and in most environments outcrossing is low (less than 5%), but in the presence of bumble bees or other large insects, out-crossing can be much higher. Flowers open early in the morning, close by noon and may fall off during the same day. The photoperiodism of many African landraces confers adaptation to a specific latitude and rainfall pattern such that flowering and pod development coincide with the end of the rainy season in a particular place ensuring that pods mature in dry weather thus avoiding pod rots and other diseases. The photosynthetic pathway is C3 and the leaves have full maximal rates of photosynthesis at full expansion. Vegetative DM production 3-10 t/ha in 8-12 weeks; grain production 250-4000 kg/ha.

Fruit a berry, ellipsoid to globose, 6-25 mm long, dark blue-purple, red, green or yellow, juicy, sweet or sour. USES: Fruits are eaten raw or dried, pressed for juice, fermented as wine, or made into jams and jellies. Residue from pressed grapes is fed to livestock or used to make tannin and cream of tartar. Grape seeds yield a drying oil used for lighting, paints and cooking. Young leaves are eaten as a vegetable. KILLING T.: Dormant vines may withstand -12°C to -20°C, new shoots and leaves are damaged at 0°C to -5°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, may be harvested after 160-180 days for early cultivars, and 190-270 days for late cultivars.

FURTHER INF.: The European wine grape is belived to have originated in the area between the Black and the Caspian seas, where it still grows wild. It is predominantly grown between 20-50°N and from 20-40°S but it can also be grown in the tropics at altitudes between 300 and 2000 m. Photosynthesis pathway C3. A sheltered, warm situation, and a long warm, or hot and dry summer is best, and the plants grow most satisfactorily when the winter is sufficiently severe to ensure a period of complete dormancy each year. High humidity and rainfall during the growing period favours diseases and tends to produce low quality grapes, 60-80% relative humidity is optimum. Light requirements are high, but only the leaves should be exposed and at the same time shield the fruits against the sun. Reported yields are between 10-90 t/ha. Sims D (pers. comm.)

It has many fasciculate roots. The erect shoot (culm) consists of four basic structures: the internodes, the leaves, the prophyll and the bud or apical meristem, which are collectively called the phytomer. The leaves that emerge from its nodes are alternate, lanceolate, acuminate and parallel-veined with small ligules. Maize is a monoecious plant; it develops inflorescences with unisexual flowers, and these are always born in separate parts of the plant. The female inflorescence - the ear, arises from the axillary bud apices, and male inflorescence, the tassel, develops from the apical growing point at the top of the plant. The kernel or fruit of maize is called a caryopsis. The ovary wall or pericarp is fused with the seed coat or testa and these combined together make the fruit wall. The mature fruit consists of three major parts - fruit wall, diploid embryo and triploid endosperm. The outermost layer of the endosperm, in contact with fruit wall is called the aleurone layer. The mature corn kernel is made up of three main parts, the seed coat or pericarp, the starchy endosperm and the embryo often called the germ, which will develop into a new plant. USES: It is mainly grown for food and fodder. The grain is ground to flour and used in starchy foods and breads. It is used in breakfast foods. Fermented grain is made into alcohol, which has become a prime use in the USA. A ton of dried maize would yield about 370 kg of ethanol. Maize starch is used in cosmetics, adhesives, glucose and syrup. Oil is extracted from the embryo and used as salad oil, and to make linolium, paints, varnishes, etc. KILLING T.: It is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. In Kenya quick-maturing lowland varieties flower in 60 days and mature in 120 days, varieties grown between 1200-2100 m in elevation flowers in 105 days and mature in 210 days, while varieties grown at 2100-3200 m may take 195 days to flower and more than 365 days to mature. In the United States on average it mature in 90-140 days. FURTHER INF.: Maize is one of the most productive species of food plants being the second most important cereal grain after wheat, with milled rice occupying third place. It is the top ranking cereal in grain yield per hectare and is second to wheat in total production. Maize is of great economic significance worldwide as human food as animal feed, and as a source of large number of industrial products. Maize has tremendous variability in kernel colour, texture, composition and appearance. It is classified into distinct types based on (a) endosperm and kernel constitution; (b) kernel colour; (c) environment in which it is grown; d) maturity; and (e) its use. White, yellow and orange are prominent grain colours. Prominent maize kernel types are flint, dent, pop, sweet, floury, morocho, and waxy. Quality Protein Maize (QPM with improved protein quality), and High Oil Corn are speciality maize types. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 4000 m and it can be grown at latitudes from 48°N to 40°S. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III for tropical lowland types and C4 IV for highland and temperate types. Hot, dry winds may reduce the amount of pollen available for fertilization and humid conditions and hail can do damage. Since the crop leaves much of the ground uncovered, soil erosion and water losses can be severe. The optimum yield is 7-11 t/ha, world average 3.6 t/ha. High yields of maize make a heavy drain on soil nutrients. It is probably indigenous to Mexico and Central America.

Ginger is mainly cultivated in the tropics from sea level to 1500 m and it thrive in hot, moist conditions, but can be grown over more diverse conditions than most other spices. Ginger originated in South East Asia, but is nowhere known in a wild state. When grown on slopes the production may result in severe erosion unless adequate soil-conservation methodes have been employed. Low temperatures will induce dormancy. The expected yield of dried ginger may be 1.5-7.5 t/ha. The dried ginger constitues about 25% of the raw rhizome's weight. Yields of green ginger can be up to 38 t/ha.

The roots rarely go deeper than about 35 cm. Towards the end of its lifespan it produces a long stout flowering pole. USES  The leaves yield a hard, coarse fiber used in the manifacture of twines, cordage, and sacks. The fiber cannot be spun as finely as jute and ropes tend to break suddenly. Fibers are also used to reinforce plaster boards and paper. The leaves contain hecogenin used in the partial synthesis of the drug cortisone. GROWING PERIOD  Short-lived perennial, with a yearly growth cycle of 150-270 days. Harvest can begin 2-4 years after planting, depending on temperature, and can continue up to about the 7-12th or even 20th year. At this stage the plant produce flowers and die. COMMON NAMES  Sisal. FURTHER INF  Sisal can in the tropics be grown at elevations up to 2000 m. It prefer moderate humidity. The species is indigenous to Central America and Mexico. One ton of fibre removes about 30 kg N, 5 kg P, 80 kg K, 65 kg Ca and 40 kg Mg from the field. Because the fibres themselves contain few minerals, the majority of the nutrients can be returned to the land with the pulp. The average yield is about 0.9 t/ha of dried fibres, on the best plantations in East Africa, yearly yields of 2.0-2.5 t/ha of dried fibres are obtained. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.

FURTHER INF  Scientific synonym: A. porrum. Elevations in the tropics of more than 500-1000 m are preferable for the production of leeks, but adequate yields may be obtained at sea level from local or specially selected cultivars. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher elevations, but leek normally does not produce seeds in the tropics. A cool period promotes early leaf production, but large plant may be obtained at high temperatures if they are well watered. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period and growth will continue as long as adequate soil moisture is available, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. Long days normally favour bulb development. Leek is considered to be indigenous to Levant in the eastern Mediterranean. Average yields in the tropics may be  about 5-20 t/ha or 0.5-2 kg/m˝ and in temperate regions yields may reach 45 t/ha.

FURTHER INF  Cashew is indigenous to tropical America probably northeastern Brazil. The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 30°N-25°S. In the tropics the tree can be found at altitudes between sea level and 1200 m where it often is grown on hillsides too dry and too stony for other crops. Photosynthesis pathway C3. Humidity should be high during the period of vegetative growth (65-80%) and lower during flowering. In general the minimum relative humidity should be about 20-25% and the maximum 35-75%. Rainfall during the flowering and harvesting periods may reduce yields. At rainfall below 500 mm the tree is only valuable for timber and firewood. It has been stated that both pigeon pea and castor bean are harmful if grown before cashew on the same land. Yields range from 2 kg/tree for young trees to 45 kg/tree for 15 year old trees. The tree is termite resistant and drought hardy. SOURCES (A. occidentale L.) Sims D (pers. comm.)

FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonym: B. eminii, B. bequaertii. Suriname grass is native of tropical East Africa. It can be found between latitudes 27 N and S at elevations from sea level to 1800 m. It has good drought tolerance and is adapted to a dry season of four or five months. However, it prefers 1,500 mm or more of rain. It does not do well where the dry season is more than five months. Within three months a complete ground cover can be obtained. It has a long growing season with productive active growth from spring to late autumn. It is very aggressive and there have been difficulties in forming long-term, stable associations with legumes. It may become a weed but can easily be ploughed out. It needs to be stocked heavily. Added nitrogen is required to keep it in active leafy growth. Frequent applications of nitrogen-up to six times per season-keep the grass in a very nutritious condition and improve live weight gain especially under high rainfall conditions. Dry matter yields may vary between 4-36 t/ha.

All parts produce a strong onion odour when crushed. Inflorescence may reach a height of 30-100 cm. Onions vary considerably in size, shape, color, and flavor. USES  It is grown for its edible, pungent bulbs, which are rich in calcium and riboflavin (vitamin B2). The bulbs can be eaten raw or cooked and they are often used for flavoring. GROWING PERIOD  Biennial, normally grown as an annual, growing 85-175 days. Requires two seasons to produce seeds. COMMON NAMES  Onion, Common onion, Bulb onion, Oignon, Cebolla, Speise-zwiebel, Ui, Sibuyas, Yeung ts'ung tau. FURTHER INF  Onion is probably indigenous to the mountain lands of central Asia where Afganistan, Iran and Pakistan meet. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher elevations. The production of bulbs is controlled by the photoperiod, the critical day-length varies from 11-16 hours, depending on the cultivar. A long, dry period is required for bulb ripening after the leaves have withered. A cool period promotes early leaf production. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. Bulb yields of up to 5-10 t/ha or 0.5-1 kg/m˝ can be obtained.

It has a deep and quick growing taproot. It has an angular stem resulting from three ribs starting from the base of each petiole. Leaves trifoliate, alternate set in a spiral along the stem. Leaflets oblong, lanceolate 5-10 cm long x 2-4 cm wide, pubescent likewise the stem. Lateral petioles, 2-3 mm the terminal one reaching 10-20 mm. Stipules linear 2-3 mm long, stipulets filiform 1-2 mm long. Flowers usually yellow but they may also be striated with purple streaks or plain red. Corolla 20-25 mm, with the flag 18-20 mm wide. Calyx 10-12 mm long, with 5 linear teeth. Inflorescence composed of racemes having 5-10 flowers on top of an axillary, little divided peduncle. Pods flat, with an acuminate tip, pubescent and of variable colour, 5-9 cm long x 12-13 mm wide, containing 2-9 seeds in shades of brown, red or black. There are 16,000-18,000 seeds per kg. Husks bearing deep, oblique furrows underline the septa between the seeds. The reproduction system is about 60 % autogamous, the chromosomic number is 2n = 22. USES: Pigeon pea is one of the most important grain legume components of subsistence farming systems in the semi-arid tropics. Plants are mainly grown for grain, green vegetables, and fodder. The young green seeds are eaten as vegetables and the ripe dry seeds as a pulse. The plant is also a good source of vitamin A. Ripe dry seeds can be split and made into dhal. Leaves, dried husks, seeds, and broken dhal are fed to cattle. For cut forage, it should be topped at a height of about 0.8 m. Under grazing conditions, it makes vigorous growth during the first year and then declines and ordinarily requires replanting every four to five years. The crop has long been used as a windbreak and shade for young coffee trees, forest seedling nurseries and vegetable beds, and is an important honey-producing plant. Leaves can also be fed to silkworms and lac insects and be used as green manure. It is planted as windbreaks and on contour for erosion control. It provides firewood and charcoal. Dried stalks serve for fuel, thatch and basketry. Pigeon pea is a legume, nodulated by Rhizobia of the cowpea group and is useful in rotational, alley or inter-cropping systems; providing nitrogen to the soil. KILLING T.: Does not tolerate frost, but will grow in temperatures to just above frost level. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, often grown as a warm-season annual. Growing period is 90-180 days for annual-production, and 130-365 days per year for perennials. Most varieties can mature and produce seeds in 100-300 days. When cultivated as a pulse crop, the plant is normally grown as an annual or biennial because production declines after the first year. When grown for forage or green manure it is usually maintained for no more than 5 years. The plant will die in about 10-12 years.

ac1480ff-7346-4fd7-8d33-1c1168318166,Camellia sinensis,"(L.) O. Kuntz Magnoliopsida:Dilleniidae:Theales:Theaceae tea, ti, chah, cha, tee 599 DESCRIPTION: Tea is a woody shrub with pale - dark green leaves under natural conditions reaching a height of 5-15 m. In cultivation it is usually trimmed to 1-2 m tall. It has a taproot or oblique root system. The taproot may reach 3 m deep, but 1.5 is the usual. Development of lateral roots depends on environmental conditions. The trunk is straight, monopodial and the bark brown to grey. When a dormant bud develops it produces 1 or 2 small non-serrated bracts 5-10 mm long, which drop shortly. Then 1-2 pre-leaves appear 7-30 mm long without serrations or prominent veins. Then, normally, 4-8 true leaves appear followed by a new dormant bud. The true leaves are persistent, alternate with short pedicels 5-10 mm long. The lamina is elliptical to lanceolate and 7-22 cm long and 3-8 wide. It is sharply acuminate at the apex and cuneiform at the base. All leaf types, whether pubescent or glabrous, tender or leathery, are glossy and very green. The China differs from the Assam variety in its leaf characteristic which is coreacious and smaller; 4-10 cm long and about 1.5 cm wide. Flowers are pedicellate and develop from leaf axils on young branches and are either solitary or in clusters of 2-3. The pedicel is 8-10 mm long, glabrous (sometimes villous) with 2-3 caducous, broad, rounded and ciliate bracts. There are 5-6 green sepals which are herbaceous and slightly membraneous, 3-5 mm long, glabrous to villous and continue up to the fruit. The white corulla has 7-8 petals attached to the base of the androecium, they have more than 200 stamens 8-13 mm long with yellow anthers. The 8-12 mm-long gynaeceum with a superior ovary is very pubescent. Tea is practically allogamous and pollination is by insects and wind. Fruits are capsules with loculicidal dehiscence and are 1-1.5 cm long and 2-3 cm in diameter with 1 to even 5 loculi, each with 2 seeds. Seeds are spherical to hemispherical, 0.8-1.6 cm in diameter and smooth and brown when mature. The endosperm has 2 cotyledons surrounding the embryo, the seed wall is hard and thick and adheres to an internal tegument which is thick, tough and shiny. There are 400-600 seeds to the kilo. USES: has been known for thousands of years and is one of today's most important beverages, cultivated on the 5 continents; cultivated first by the Chinese over 3000 years ago and introduced to Europe in the beginning of the 17th century. Depending on whether the leaves undergo fermentation the tea is black or green. Green leaves are steamed and dried to produce green tea or leaves are withered, fermented, and dried to provide black tea. It has a stimulant effect due to caffeine. Steam distillation of black tea yields an essential oil. Tea extract is used as a flavour in alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy desserts, candy, baked goods, gelatins, and puddings. Air-dried tea seed yields a clear golden-yellow oil resembling sasanqua oil, but the seed cake, containing saponin, is not suitable for fodder. Refined tea seed oil, made by removing the free fatty acids with caustic soda, then bleaching the oil with Fuller's earth and a sprinkling of bone black, makes an oil suitable for use in manufacture of oil for burning purposes, and in all respects is considered a favourable substitute for rapeseed, olive, or lard oils. The oil is different from cottonseed, corn, or sesame oils in that it is a non-drying oil and is not subject to oxidation changes, thus making it very suitable for use in the textile industry; it remains liquid below -18 .C. Tea is a potential source of food colours (black, green, orange, yellow, etc.). KILLING T.: 0 to -5°C depending on the cultivar, var. sinensis withstands -5°C, whereas the leaves of var. assamica are killed by 0°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Harvest of leaves may begin after 2-5 years and reaches a maximum at 7-10 years. The growth cycle is 240-365 days, fruits takes 270-360 days to mature and seeds are normally produced after 4-5 years. The economic life of the plant is about 40 years, but sometimes the shrubs are kept in production 60-70, or even 100 years. COMMON NAMES: Tea, The, Te, Tee, Tsa. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: , , , , . Tea can be grown in subtropical lowland and up to about 1800 m or even 2400-3000 m in the tropics, but the majority of the production takes place between 750 and 1500 m. Tea originates in the mountains of Southeast Asia, it is now grown between 40°N and 33°S. Hail can cause great damage and windbreaks are beneficial. To low and too high humidity can reduce yields and encourage disease. Harvesting: Terminal sprouts with 2-3 leaves are usually hand-plucked, 10 kg of green shoots (75-80% water) produce about 2.5 kg of dried tea. Bushes are plucked every 7-15 days, depending on the development of the tender shoots. One ton of tea removes 45-60 kg N, 4-7 kg P and 20-30 kg K from the field. Optimum yield is about 3.0 t/ha, in Africa average yields are between 0.5-2.0 t/ha. Because most tea plants are grown on hillsides, erosion control is often necessary. Sims D (pers. comm.)

FURTHER INF: Scientific synonyms: C. quianensis, C. paraquariensis, C. mexicana, C. occidentalis, C. sintenisii. West Indian cedar can be found naturally growing in Mexico, through Central America to Argentina. It occurs at elevations from sea level to 1500 m. The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 26°N-28°S. In its natural area of distribution, it is found in both primary and secondary evergreen to semi-deciduous lowland or lower mountain rainforest. It demands light and does not tolerate waterlogging or flooding. Widely distributed in wet forests of low elevations in tropical America. Trees are best planted in regions with very fertile soils and with perfect drainage that results in the good aeration of the soil required by the root system. Drought for part of the year does not adversely affect the health of the tree. In its natural habitat, removing trees around the seed tree and gradually opening up the canopy in the forest can encourage regeneration. The tree is often found close to streams and water requirements may on sites with less than 1200 mm of annual rainfall also depend on other sources. Annual wood production potential is 11-22 m3/ha.

26a1de54-ab33-4dbe-a303-5a6ce8de6dd5,Cocos nucifera,"Linnaeus Liliopsida:Arecidae:Arecales:Palmae coconut, cocotier, palma de coco, cocotero, côco, narial, thengai, kokospalme, ye, tree of life, tree of heaven, kalpaviriksha, tree of abundance, natures supermarket, kulau, coir fibre, (See ""Notes"" for hybrid names) 744 DESCRIPTION: The coconut is an evergreen palm, in strict botanical terms it is not a tree. It has no bark, branches, cambium or secondary growth. It is a woody, perennial monocotyledon and its trunk is a stem, which grows to about 25 m and exceptionally 30m; dwarf selections also exist. Being a monocotyledon the coconut has no taproot and adventitious roots develop continually from the bole. Roots may spread from the bole in any direction and at any angle below the horizontal for up to 10 m or more, depending on soil and water supply. The m ain roots are about 10mm in diameter with secondary and tertiary branches. When young they are coloured white to cream and have a very sharp tipped growing point below a loose root cap about 12mm long. There are no root hairs. The rate of elongation is not uniform and the root takes on a banded appearance as it matures and its colour darkens through shades of orange. When growth eventually ceases the root is brown with a tip that is rounded and blunt. The smallest branches are about 1-2mm in diameter and are short lived and frequently replaced. Where they occur at, or in wet conditions sometimes above, ground level the secondary and tertiary roots remain as very small, peg-like pneumatophores, or ""breathing roots"". It has a smooth, columnar, light grey-brown trunk, with a mean diameter of 30-40 cm at breast height, and topped with a terminal crown of leaves. Trunk slender and slightly swollen at the base, usually erect but may be leaning or curved and marked with leaf scars.. Leaves pinnate, polymorphic, feather shaped, 4-7m long and 1-1.5 m wide at the broadest part. Leaf stalks 1-2 cm in length and thornless. The inflorescence consists of female and male axillary flowers. Flowers small, light yellow, in clusters that emerge from canoe-shaped sheaths among the leaves. Male flowers small and more numerous. Female flowers fewer and occasionally completely absent; larger, spherical structures, about 25 mm in diameter. Fruit roughly ovoid, up to 15-25 cm long and composed of a thick, fibrous husk surrounding a somewhat spherical nut with a hard, brittle, hairy shell. The nut is 2-2.5 cm in diameter and 3-4 cm long. Three sunken holes of softer tissue, called ?eyes?, are at one end of the nut. Inside the shell is a thin, white, fleshy layer known as the ?meat?. The interior of the nut is hollow but partially filled with a watery liquid called ?coconut milk?. The meat is soft and jellylike when immature but becomes firm with maturity. Coconut milk is abundant in unripe fruit but is gradually absorbed as ripening proceeds. The fruits are green at first, turning brownish as they mature; yellow varieties go from yellow to brown. USES: Food: Copra, the dried coconut endosperm, contains an edible cooking oil (coconut oil). The apical region of (?millionaire salad?) is a food delicacy in areas where it is grown. Other food derivatives of coconut include coconut chips, coconut jam, coconut honey, coconut candy and other desserts. Fodder: Copra meal and coconut cake, the residues of oil extraction from copra containing approximately 20% protein, 45% carbohydrate, 11% fibre, fat, minerals and moisture, are used in cattle feed rations. Apiculture: is an important pollen source for honey production. Where sap is tapped from unopened inflorescences for toddy-making, many bees drain in the collecting pots. The honey may be greenish-yellow like the motor oil and crystal clear if monofloral. Granulation is medium (takes up to 3 months). Fuel: The high moisture content of wood and the difficulty of splitting it has made it relatively unpopular as firewood. Coconut shell charcoal is a major source of domestic fuel in the Philippines. It is also exported to Japan and the USA. Coconut oil can be used as a substitute for diesel oils, for electric generating plants and motor vehicles. Fibre: Three types of fibres are obtained from the coconut husks: mat fibre or yarn fibre, used in making mats; bristle fibre, used for brush making; and mattress fibre, used in stuffing mattresses and in upholstery. Leaflets are used in braiding mats, baskets and hats. Timber: C. nucifera timber has traditionally been used in tropical countries for the structural framework of houses. Coconut timber taken from the lower and middle parts of the trunk can be used for load-bearing structures in buildings, such as frames, floors and trusses. Coconut trunks can be used for poles, as they have great strength and flexibility. The wood can also be used for furniture and parquet flooring. Lipids: The oil contains fatty alcohol and glycerine used in soaps, detergents, shampoos cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and explosives. Alcohol: Sap from the tender, unopened inflorescence (coconut palm sap) is used in the producing areas for toddy, or tuba, a beverage obtained by natural fermentation. Tuba contains 6-7.5% alcohol. The distillation of fermented coconut toddy yields a spirit called arrack, produced commercially in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Other products: Coconut-shell flour, obtained from grinding clean, mature coconut shells to fine powder, is used as a filler in thermoplastic industry and an abrasive for cleaning machinery. Coconut-shell charcoal may be processed further into activated carbon that has many industrial applications, including general water purification, crystalline sugar preparation and gold purification. The edible mushrooms of the genus Auricularis grow well on coconut stems and are readily sold in China and elsewhere. Soil improver: Burnt husks form a useful sort of potash that is used to fertilize the trees. The husks also make valuable mulch for moisture conservation in the dry season and help to suppress weeds. Ornamental: Planted widely as an ornamental tree. Intercropping: Coconut palm is one of the most widely grown tree crops in the tropical countries. Its growth characteristics are ideal for small production and also for combining with other crops. The crown morphology and the relatively wide spacing facilitate the planting of a wide spectrum of field crops in coconut plantations. It has therefore been intercropped with cereals (cassava, sweet potatoes, yams) or fruits (bananas, passion fruit, pineapples and ground nuts) in many countries including Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines etc. KILLING T.: Will withstand a small amount of frost. The lowest temperatures tolerated for long periods are for palm 10°C, for leaves 15°C, and for flowers 20°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Flowering begins at 5-7 years, (dwarf varieties 3.5-4.5 years). The palm reaches full bearing after 10-12 years, maturity at about 15 years and lives up to between 60 and 100 years in the wild state, and 50-70 years under cultivation. There is a 360-365 day yield cycle. The inflorescence is initiated 16 months before the spathe opens and the nut takes about a year to mature from the time of pollination.

Please see notes in the EcoPort link for hybrid names. FURTHER INF.: The coconut palm probably originated from the Melanesian region. It is generally grown within 26°N and S and the most suitable climates are found between 10°N and S. For good yields coconut requires small temperature differences between day and night, because of this it is normally grown no higher than 700-950 m above sea level even at the equator. It can though be found up to 1500 m in a few areas near the equator. Areas where drainage is poor are not satisfactory unless the water rises and falls frequently, as is the case near a tidal estuary. The photosynthesis pathway is C 3. Normally 84-97% relative humidity is required for good production, 63% is about the minimum for production and the monthly mean should not fall below 60%. It is popularly known as ?Tree of Life?, ?Tree of Heaven?, ?Kalpaviriksha?, ?Tree of Abundance?, ?Natures? Supermarket? and is grown in more than 93 countries in an area of 11.85 million ha with production of 10.39 million tonnes of copra equivalent. It sustains millions of small holders for their livelihood.

Magnoliopsida:Asteridae:Rubiales:Rubiaceae coffee arabica, arabian coffee, arabica coffee, kafei, kofe, cafe, Kaffee, yebuna fire, buna 749 DESCRIPTION: A globose evergreen, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree attaining heights of up to 5-10 m (when not pruned). The root system of the mature coffee tree consists of: a taproot, which is often extensively branched, robust, and generally short (0.3 to 0.5 m), but may grow as long as 1.0 m in deep soils. A number of secondary roots develop from the taproot and grow vertically downwards. The lighter and more penetrable the soil, the deeper they will develop. Their role, together with that of the taproot, is to assist in anchorage and supplying water to the plant. Lateral roots, which are generally numerous, develop, often almost horizontally, and are further extended by a network of rootlets. They explore the superficial and richest layers of the soil. Their role is essentially to provide mineral nutrition to the plant. Its branches are opposite, long, flexible, and rather thin; its habit is semi-erect when young and spreading or pendulous when adult. The petiolate leaves are dark glossy green, simple, opposite, acuminate; having a short petiole with undulating margins and a slightly crinkled surface, they are 10-15 cm long and 4-6 cm wide, sometimes bearing interpetiolar stipules. They have a prominent leaf midrib and lateral veins. Flowers produced in dense clusters along reproductive branches in the axils of the leaves. White, sweet scented, star-shaped and carried on stout but short peduncles. Bracteoles united, forming a cup-shaped epicalyx at the base of the flower. There are 5 calyx segments halfway the length, spreading out very widely at the anthesis and 5 stamens inserted in the corolla tube. Anthers carried on long, slender, upright filaments. It is about 90% autogamous (self-fertile) thus a great number of its flowers are fertilised before anthesis. Ovary inferior, 2 united unilocular carpels, each containing a single ovule attached to the base of the carpel wall. The ovary bears a slender style, which terminates in short, pointed bifid stigmas. The ovary is in the form of a drupe, and is commonly called a cherry. The cherry is ovoid or sub-globulous, red when ripe, 10-15 mm wide and 16-18 mm long, and consists of a coloured exocarp (skin), a fleshy, yellowish-white mesocarp (pulp) and two beans or seeds (8.5-12.5 mm long, ellipsoidal in shape and pressed together by flattened surface that is deeply grooved; outer surface convex) joined together along their flat sides. When one of the two ovaries aborts, the other develops into an ovoid bean, which is commercially known as a 'peaberry'. Each bean is protected by two coats. The first, the endocarp, is thin with a fibrous texture (parchment) and the second, the perisperm, is a very fine membrane (skin or silverskin) that more or less adheres to the bean. The size and shape of the beans differ depending on variety, environmental conditions, and cropping practices. On average, they are 10 mm long, 6-7 mm wide and 3-4 mm thick. They weigh 0.15-0.20 g. Dried seeds, after removal of the silvery skin, provide the coffee beans of commerce. The optimum temperature for the germination of coffee seeds is about 30°-32°C, below 10°C germination is very slow. USES: Food: Dried seeds (?beans?) are roasted, ground, and brewed to make 1 of the 2 most popular beverages in the world. In its native Ethiopia, it has been used as a masticatory since ancient times. Cooked in butter, it can be used to make rich flat cakes. Coffee is widely used as flavouring in ice cream, pastries, candies, and liqueurs. In Arabia, a fermented drink from the pulp is consumed. Fodder: Pulp and parchment are occasionally fed to cattle in India. Apiculture: Honeybees collect nectar and pollen from the flowers. The honey is light with a characteristic flavour. Mixed coffee-orange honey is very highly valued. Timber: Wood is hard, dense, durable, takes a polish well, and is suitable for tables, chairs and turnery. The bark can be made into pulp, parchment, manure and mulch. Soil improver: The pulp and parchment are used as manure and mulches. Annual litter fall from both shade and crop trees, including pruning residues, maintain soil organic matter levels and hence the cation exchange capacity; this reduces the risk of leaching losses and permits a more efficient use of any inorganic fertilizers applied. Intercropping: is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans or rice, during the 1st few years. Poison: seeds contain caffeine, which has been described as a natural herbicide, selectively inhibiting germination of seeds of . Medicine: Reported to be analgesic, an aphrodisiac, anorexic, antidotal, cardiotonic, CNS-stimulant, counterirritant, diuretic, hypnotic, lactagogue and nervine. Coffee is a folk remedy for asthma, tropine poisoning, fever, flu, headache, jaundice, malaria, migraine, narcosis, nephrosis, opium poisoning, sores and vertigo. Other products: Coffelite, a type of plastic, is made from coffee beans. Coffee with iodine is used as a deodorant. KILLING T.: Some varieties have been reported to withstand -4°C. Temperatures at -5- -8°C may kill the plant within an hour or two. At temperatures from 0-2°C, which are not unusual in some production areas, the foliar tissue and green shoots are killed. This is manifested by almost complete defoliation of the shrubs, the drying out of the young branches (black tip), and with an appreciable loss in the harvest. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Begins to bear in 2-3 years, is in full bearing at 6-8 years, and produces economic yields for 30-40 years on average, though in some cases only 10-15 years, and in others up to 50-70 years. Plants of 80-100 years are known. Fruits mature 210-270 days after flowering, and the growth cycle is 240-330 days. COMMON NAMES: (Burmese): ka-phi, (Creole): kafe, (English): Abyssinian coffee, Arabian coffee, arabica coffee, Brazilian coffee, coffee, coffee tree, (Filipino): kafe, (French): café, caféier, (German): Bergkaffee, (Indonesian): kopi, (Khmer): kafae, (Spanish): café, cafeto, (Swahili): kahawa, (Thai): gafae, (Trade name): arabica coffee, (Vietnamese): Cà phê. FURTHER INF.: The generic name is derived from the Arabic word used for the drink, which, despite its name, may have come from the region of Kefa in Ethiopia; it is indigenous to the wet highland forests of Ethiopia. It can in equatorial regions be grown at elevations from 1300 to 2800 m, with 1500-1900 being usual, at 15°N or S it can be grown down to about 500 m. In the subtropics it is grown from sea level to 1000 m. The latitudinal range is between 22°N and 27°S. With too much rainfall the plant tends to develop wood at the expense of flowers and fruits. One to 2 months of less than 50 mm rain facilitates uniform flowering. Heavy rain during and after harvest is not desirable. It will only flower when days are 13 hours or shorter. Medium humidity is best, periods of mist and low clouds are beneficial but arabica require 2-3 drier months for the initiation of flower buds. The photosynthesis pathway is C 3. Processing: The ripe fruits of coffee are normally processed in the production area. They go through a certain number of operations, the objectives of which are to extract the beans from their covering of pulp, mucilage, parchment and film, and to improve their appearance. Two techniques are used to obtain clean coffee beans: Wet processing in which the fresh fruit is processed in three stages: a) Removal of the pulp and mucilage and washing, b) Drying of parchment coffee, c) Removal of the inner coverings, parchment, and film (hulling). Dry processing which consists of two stages: Drying of the fruit (coffee berries or cherry coffee), and b) Removal of the dried coverings in a single mechanical operation (hulling). Optimum yield of clean dry coffee beans is 2-3 t/ha obtained in Kenya, while average yields are about 0.5 t/ha in Brazil and 0.9 t/ha in Africa. An important disease in coffee is leaf rust, caused by , it is most serious at low altitudes and when trees are weakened by overbearing. Resistance breeding has reduced the severity of this disease. Just as severe is coffee berry disease caused by . Sims D (pers. comm.)

FURTHER INF  Chives are mostly cultivated in temperate climates, but yields are generally good at higher elevations in the tropics. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher elevations. A cool period promotes early leaf production. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. Long days normally favour bulb development. SOURCES (A. schoenoprasum L.)

The root varies in length from 5-25 cm. In the second year the plant may produce an inflorescence and reach 20-100 cm in height. The inflorescence is a compound umbrel and the small flowers are white or pink. USES  The roots are eaten fresh, cooked, or pickled as a vegetable and pressed for juice, canned, or dehydrated. They are a good source of carotene, vitamins, and sugar. An essential oil is extracted from the seeds and used for flavoring and in perfumes. GROWING PERIOD  Biennial, normally grown as a cool-season annual. Carrot seeds are small and germinate slowly, and the tiny seedlings require some time to become established. Baby carrots can be harvested after 60-80 days, while full-size carrots require 70-150 days. It requires two seasons to produce seed. COMMON NAMES  Carrot, Queen Anne`s lance, Carotte Potagere, Zanahoria, Mohre Karotte, Peen, Gajar, Bortol. KILLING T  Leaves will not tolerate -1.5°C.  FURTHER INF  Carrot is native of Europe and parts of Asia. In the tropics, carrot should be grown at altitudes above 500 m for commercial production. Humidity should be moderate. Optimum temperature for germination is 15-25°C, maximum is 35°C. In the seedling stage the plants are sensitive to both high and low temperatures. Many young plants may be injured or killed on hot, sunny days. Long periods of hot weather often cause a strong flavor and cause root texture. Temperatures below 10°C tend to cause longer, more slender, and paler roots. Pale roots are also produced at temperatures above 25°C. Heavy clay soils tend to cause restricted root development and forked roots. Short days may reduce the ·-carotene content of the roots. Photosynthesis pathway C3. SOURCES (Daucus carota L.)

The trunk is large, buttressed and angled towards the base. Roots shallow. Flowers orange-red, almost  scarlet and slightly fragrant. USE: Flowers are reputed to produce bee forage. The large pods as well as the wood are used for fuel. The bark yields gum and has medicinal properties. It is planted as a shade tree and living fence in dairy farms, tea plantations and compounds and as an ornamental in gardens. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Flamboyant, Poinciana, Krishna chira. FURTHER INF: Scientific synonym: Poinciana regia. It originates from Madagascar, where it is now almost extinct. It is now widespread in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Trees can grow at higher altitudes than recommended, but flowering becomes erratic. The tree demands light and grows weakly and sparsely under shade. It grows in areas with both high and scanty rainfall. It has a superficial root system and competes successfully with the neighbouring shrubs and flowering plants, rendering bare the ground under its canopy. It should therefore be planted away from other plants in the gardens. Trees are deciduous only where the dry season is long and pronounced. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 2000 m. The range of natural occurrence is 12-15°S. The tree is fast growing and tolerant of salt winds. The tree seems to tolerate many types of soils from clay to sandy, but it prefers sandy soils.

The crown is conical and leaves simple, 8-20 cm long. The fruit is ovoid to ellipsoid with hard, conical projections on the surface, 5-30 cm long and 1.5-8 kg in weight, with a dull green to light yellowish green surface and with a strong odor. USES  The fruit pulp is eaten fresh, cooked as a vegetable or in soups, made into a sauce, or processed into various products. It can be frozen, dried, fermented, salted or dried and boild with sugar. The pulp is a source of carbohydrates, and vitamins B and C. The seeds are eaten dried, roasted, fried in coconut oil, or boiled, and used in confections. Seeds are rich in proteins and carbohydrates. The rind of the fruit is dried and used as fuel. Several parts of the tree have medicinal properties. The light wood is not durable, but is used for indoor constructions and cheaper types of furniture. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD  Perennial. Seedlings fruit after about 7-12 years and grafted trees after 4-5 years. The fruit takes 3 months to ripe. There may be two crops per year for 50 years.

FURTHER INF  Scientific synonym: D. acuminatissima. Durian is a native of south-eastern Asia, particularly Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. It is strictly tropical and can be grown within the latitudinal range 18°N-S. It performs best at elevations between sea level and 800 m. In Malaysia and Thailand it is usually grown below 300 m. It needs shade when young. The tree is adapted to warm and humid growing conditions but it can tolerate 2-3 dry months. Short relatively dry spells may stimulate flowering. A sheltered site is desirable to prevent branches laden with fruit from breaking in the wind. Heavy soils may lead to root rot. Up to 50-100 fruits per tree per year or a yield of 10-18 t/ha can be expected from a good orchard. Average yields are, however, often only 3-8 t/ha. SOURCES (D. zibethinus Murr.)

Gaertn. oil palm, palmier à huile, palma aceitera, palma de aceite, dende, Ölpalme, youzonglu, nahkhil al zite, oilepalme, olie palm, kelapa sawit 972 DESCRIPTION: An unbranched, evergreen palm, reaching a height of 18-30 m with a stout trunk, up to 22-75 cm in diameter, covered with persistent leaf bases. The tree has adventitious roots growing from the bottom one meter of the trunk, and a few deeply penetrating roots that anchor the tree, but most of the roots grow horizontally in the top one meter of the soil, and as far away as 20 m from the bole. The stem terminates in a crown of leaves at the very top, 70-100 leaves, up to 7.5 m long, are produced in spiral succession from the apical meristem. The inflorescences are compound spikes, one borne in the axil of each leaf. The palm is monoecious and male and female flowers do not appear on the plant at the same time. Cross-pollination therefore almost always occurs. After fertilization, the female inflorescence develops into the fruit bunch. Each bunch may contain about 200 fruits. A single bunch may weigh 18-25 kg, of which 60-65% is fruit. The fruits are fibrous drupes about 4 cm long and 2 cm broad, with a pointed apex and a leathery, fairly thin exocarp surrounding the fleshy mesocarp, a hard endocarp and a seed. USES: Palm oil has saturated palmitic acids, as well as oleic and linoleic acids. It can be used in the manufacture of soap and candles and in the tin plate industry. It is the most productive species for bio-diesel. It contains vitamins A and E. Palm kernel oil is very similar to coconut oil and is used in edible fats, in the preparation of ice cream and mayonnaise, and in the manufacture of soaps and detergents. By tapping the male inflorescence, a wine can be made and the central shoot or cabbage of the palm is edible. The press cake from palm kernel oil can be used for animal feed. KILLING T.: 0 C at during rest or at early growth. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. FURTHER INF.: Elaeis belongs to the palm subfamily Cocoideae. African oil palm is indigenous to the humid tropics of West Africa. It occurs wild along the banks of rivers and streams in the transition zone between rain forest and open savanna, at latitudes between 3°N and 7°S. The cultivation is essentially limited to regions between 10°N and S. It can be found up to 1300 m in elevation near the equator. For commercial production altitudes above 500-700 m were considered unsuitable, but cold tolerance has extended this to 1500m. Growth rate is significantly affected below 20 C and there is no growth below 15 C. However, yields should not be significantly affected if the temperature drops below 20 C for a few hours at night only. With cold tolerance it can withstand temperatures of 12 C. It can tolerate temporary flooding, provided the water is not stagnant. Photosynthesis pathway C3II. Relative humidity should be higher than 75% in areas of commercial production and rainfall should be evenly distributed throughout the year. It requires adequate light and at least five hours of sunshine per day in all months of the year is desirable. Seedling growth stops at temperatures below 15 C. High winds can be harmful. CULTIVATION AND POST HARVEST TREATMENT: CROPPING SYSTEM: Oil palm can be a useful agroforestry species. On smallholdings oil palms are often intercropped with food crops such as maize, millet, cassava, cocoyams, groundnuts or bananas. This can be done for up to three years. On larger plantations, soil cover crops of legumes and grasses are often used. PROPAGATION: The plant is propagated from seed, that, however, germinate irregular and very slowly. To hasten the process, the moistened seeds can be mixed with charcoal and put in small boxes and then into polythene bags. These are laid in so called ""germinators"" for about 40 days at 38-40°C in low relative humidity. Then the seeds are allowed to absorb water and are held at 28-30°C for another 10-40 days. Seeds can also be germinated at the above temperature but without bags, then they should be watered every three days. A wet sack on the floor can help to keep the atmosphere damp. About 80% of the fresh seeds and 50-60% of stored seeds will germinate, but not at the same time and each week the germinated seeds should be removed. PRE-NURSERY: The germinated seeds are fragile and should therefore first be planted in prepared beds, trays, baskets or bags before being transferred to the field nursery. Soils for the pre-nursery should be well-drained, friable, fertile topsoil. The beds should be 20-23 cm high and not more than 120 cm wide. The trays 120 x 60 cm and 15-20 cm deep, while the baskets and polythene bags should be 23 cm deep and 10-15 cm in diameter. The sprouted seeds are planted carefully at a distance of 7.5 x 7.5 cm, their delicate roots pointing downwards and covered with 2.5 cm of soil. After 4-6 months, when the seedlings reach the 4-5 leaf stage, they are transferred to the field nursery FIELD-NURSERY: Here the seedlings are planted at a distance of 75-90 cm apart or in large polythene bags. They remain in the nursery 6-12 months before being transplanted to the field. The nursery area should be flat and near a water source. The soil should be as in the pre-nursery and organic manure should be incorporated before planting. FIELD: Seedlings should be between 10-18 months when they are transplanted to the field. It is best to move the seedlings with a substantial ball of earth (35-45 cm in diameter around their roots). When bare-root planting is necessary the roots should be dipped in a clay slurry as soon as they are lifted. Some leaf pruning may be necessary to reduce the seedlings height to about 1.2 m. The optimum planting density is about 123-140 palms per ha, which is the same as a planting distance of 8-9x9 m. New compact hybrids developed by ASD Costa Rica allow up to 170 palms per ha with corresponding yield increases due to the compact canopy; harvesting is also simplified due to their lower height. In areas with seasonal rainfall the transplanting should be done at the beginning of the rain, while in areas with a better rainfall distribution it can be done year round. LAND PREPARATION: The area around the planting holes should be cleared of all vegetation to a radius of 1 m. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Begins to bear in 3-4 years, is in full production in 8-10 years and is usually cut down at 25-35 years, when the palm gets to tall and unpractical to harvest. Specimens have been known to live 200 years. The inflorescence develops in the apical bud for two years. After pollination fruit takes 150-180 days to mature. The tree requires a growing period of at least 270 days per year, the optimum is more than 300 days and the tree can grow throughout the year. FERTILIZATION: One ton of fruit removes about 6 kg N, 1 kg P, 8 kg K, 0.8 kg Ca and 0.6 kg Mg from the field. Typical fertilizer recommendations in West Africa would be: 114 g of N, P2O5, K2O and Mg in 1:1:1:2 per seedling in the nursery, 15 kg N, 24 kg K2O, 4 kg Mg per hectare at transplantation, 15 kg N, 45 kg K2O, 7 kg Mg per hectare in the first year after transplantation, 30 kg N, 60 kg K2O, 10 kg Mg per hectare in the second year after transplantation, 30 kg N, 75 kg K2O, 17 kg Mg per hectare in all subsequent years. The fertilizer should be applied in a ring 7.5-15 cm from the seedlings and about 1.5 meter from the mature palm. IRRIGATION: Required in the early stages and later during dry periods. WEED CONTROL: An area around each palm and a passage between the palms should be kept free of vegetation. For mature palms the vegetation free area should be about 2.5 m in diameter. PEST AND DISEASES: With good care and careful selection of plants, disease control in the stand is not usually necessary. Where there is danger from rodents young plants should be protected by a wire collar. The principal diseases of oil palm are blast, freckle and anthracnose. Common pests are palm weevils, leaf miners, slug caterpillars, but also rats, porcupines, wild pigs, elephants and palm-nut vulture can damage the palms. HARVESTING: The fruit bunches are cut off or knocked down when the fruit is ripe. The correct time for harvesting is in most cultivars indicated by the change in colour from black to orange or by the fall of the first individual fruits. Usually only one bunch on the tree ripens at a time. The ripe bunches should be cut very carefully to avoid damage to the subtending leaf. YIELDS: It produces the two distinct oils, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Palm oil is obtained from the fleshy, orange mesocarp of the fruit, which contains 45-55 % oil, and palm kernel oil is obtained from the kernel or endosperm which contains about 50% oil. The best plantations yield about 30 t/ha of fruit per year. From that, about 7 tons of palm oil and 0.8 tons of kernel oil can be extracted. Oil palms can give a higher yield of oil per unit area than any other crop. In older plantations the yields are however often only about 3.5 tons oil per ha. per year. POST HARVEST TREATMENT: The fruit bunches are almost always damaged during harvest and must be taken to the factory as soon as possible and should be processed within 24 hours. Sims D (pers. comm.)

It is planted as a shade tree in cocoa and coffee plantations, for reforestation, as living fence and as an ornamental. Where rainfall is irregular and sometimes below 1000 mm per year, it has been noted to persist in prolonged drought without losing its leaves, recirculating nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from prunings. It is therefore a promising species for agroforestry systems in such areas where it would be intercropped with maize and cassava. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: coral bean, purple coral-tree. FURTHER INF: It is a pioneer species, most commonly found on the outer margins of swamps on sites that are not permanently flooded. It seems to prefer littoral locations with badly drained soils like swamps and stream banks and upland riverine marshes. In an experiment, it has shown good performance in acid soils of pH 4.3 and aluminum saturation of 80%.

FURTHER INF  Scientific synonyms: A. ascalonicum, A. cepa var. ascalonicum, A. cepa var. multiplicans, A. cepa var. solaninum. Shallot can in the tropics be grown at elevations between sea level and 2500 m. The optimum photoperiod varies from 12 hours for the short-day cultivars to 15 hours for the long-day cultivars. High temperatures encourage bulb formation, but flower formation and seed production are only possible where the bulbs are subjected to low temperatures. In the tropics, flower and seed formation will therefore only occur at higher elevations. A cool period promotes early leaf production. Moist soil is required throughout the growing period, but excessive soil water and high humidity encourage diseases. A dry period is required for curing the bulbs. Long days normally favour bulb development. Average fresh bulb yields in Indonesia is about 6 t/ha, under good growing conditions yields of 10-18 t/ha can be obtained.

7be8a6ea-ae5f-4ce3-bdb1-683276a96699,Hordeum vulgare,"L. Liliopsida:Commelinidae:Cyperales:Gramineae See Notes barley, cebada, orge, damai, cevada, gebs, Gerste 1232 DESCRIPTION: A freely tillering cultivated grass and cereal crop reaching a height of 50-100 cm. As with wheat and oats, barley also presents two types of root systems. In the first, the seedling roots develop from germination to the tillering stage; in the second, which starts at tillering, the secondary crown roots, or adventitious roots, appear. These will serve to anchor the plant, and to provide it with water and nutrients. The depth they reach will depend on the hydric condition of the soil, its texture and structure, external and internal temperatures, and on the genetic make up of the variety. The stems of the barley plant are erect and made up of 5 to 7 hollow, cylindrical internodes or joints, separated by the nodes, which bear the leaves. As in all Gramineae, the leaves are placed opposite their neighbours along the stem. The leaves are linear lanceolate and formed of sheath, blade, auricles and ligule. The sheaths surround the stem completely. The ligule, and especially the auricles, distinguish barley from other cereal grains: they are glabrous, envelop the stem and can be pigment with anthocyanins. Flowers-spikes: the last internode of the stem extends as a rachis, which bears the spicules alternating on its nodes. Spikes of distich barleys do not have a terminal spicule as do those of wheat. Spikes can be awned, mutic (blunt) or hooded, and also can be smooth or toothed. The spikes can have two or six rows of grain, depending on the fertility of the lateral spikes. The rachis has 10 to 30 nodes, so the ears of six-row barleys can have from 25 up to 60 grains, and two-row barleys 25 to 30. The fruit is an oval, ridged caryopsis with rounded ends. The spike may be long or short, according to the plant type, but it always has several glumes with filiform awns that may diverge. Seeds are generally covered, with the palea and the lemma adhered to them, or can be open. Grains can be white in colour, blue, black, etc. Barley is predominantly autogamous. USES: In the traditional areas, most barley is use for animal feed (half of the world's barley production). In the non-traditional areas, barley's principal use is as food, followed by animal feed and use as raw material for the malting industry. Pearl barley (used in soups, or fed to live stock) is the decorticated caryopsis, while barley that is allowed to germinate and is then dehydrated is called malt. A very nourishing drink made from the latter can be used as a substitute for coffee. Barley is also used commercially in the making of beer and whiskey. The cereal is prepared for eating by boiling or parching the whole grain. It can then be ground for gruel or made into flour for baking. Barley can also be grown as a hay crop. The caryopsis is used to prepare decoctions and fluid extract. It has nutritive, emollient and anticatarrhal properties. KILLING T.: The main climatic mishap is frost damage to the seedlings, when the death of many plants can drastically thin out the crop. At the seedling stage, barley is more susceptible to freezing conditions than wheat. The minimum temperature for germination occurs between 3-4°C, the optimal temperature being about 20°C, and the maximum temperature between 28-30°C. GROWING PERIOD: Annual grass, can be harvested after 90-120 days for spring varieties, and after 180-240 days for winter varieties. COMMON NAMES: barley, food barley, feed barley, malting barley, orge, cebada, gerste, gebs, garbu, segem, schair, sheko, bongo. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonym: . Barley is grown from 70°N in Europe to arid regions near the Sahara and up to 4700 m in elevation in the Himalayas. In the tropics, the plant can normally only be successfully grown at elevations above 1800 m and in moderate to low humidity. Geographically, barley is the most widely distributed of all cereal crops. The crop is cultivated from Alten in Norway (70º N), inside the Arctic Circle, to tropical Timbuktu in Mali at around 17ºN. In the Americas, it is grown from latitude 65ºN in Alaska Nilan, 1964 to 53ºS in southern Chile. The photosynthesis pathway is C3 I. Yields in the United States vary between 1-5 t/ha while the average yields in Africa are about 1.2 t/ha. Heavy impermeable soils and light acid soils are unsuitable for barley. Sims D (pers. comm.)

The plant forms tuberous roots that are mostly located within the top 25 cm of the soil. Tubers vary largely in shape, colour and texture. The stems form running vines up to 4 m long, usually prostrate and slender, with milky juice, lateral stem-branches arising from the short stem are not usually branched. The leaves are variable, ovate-cordate, borne singly on long petioles, palmately veined, angular or lobed, depending on variety, green or purplish. At the end of the vine, trumpet shaped hermaphrodite flowers are formed during the summer; they are white or pale violet, axillary, funnel-shaped, borne singly or in cymes on short peduncles. They are, however, rare, especially in United States. In late summer and spring the plant forms round pods with flattened, hard-coated, angular seeds and there are 1-4 seed per pod. USES: It is cultivated for its edible tubers. They are eaten boiled, baked, candied with syrup, or pureed and they are processed like potatoes into fried chips, starch, flour, glucose and they can be canned and dehydrated. The tubers have a high concentration of carbohydrates in the form of sugar and starch. Plant tops and leaves are used as potherbs and the vine as a fodder. Greatly esteemed as feed for farm animals; with 3 kg green sweet potatoes equivalent to 1 kg of maize, with a food value rated 95-100% that of maize. Dry vines a have feed value which compares favorably with alfalfa hay as forage The sweet potato is being regarded as a valuable raw material for producing alcohol bio-fuel. The leaf decoction is used medicinally. KILLING T.: May be damaged below 10°C. Very sensitive to temperatures below 1°C for brief periods and 3°C for longer periods. GROWING PERIOD: Warm-season perennial herb, cultivated as an annual, may be harvested after 80-360 days. A frost-free period of 110-170 days is necessary.

FURTHER INF.: Grown between latitudes 40°N and 32°S at elevations up to 2800 m in equatorial regions, and otherwise up to about 2000 m. The species is indigenous to Central America, and the north-western part of South America. Distinct differences between day and night temperatures encourage the formation of tuberous roots. A photoperiod of less than 11 hours induces flowering, less flowering occurs at 12 hours and none at all at 13 hours daylight. Above 30°N and S little flowering occurs. Low humidity as the crop approaches maturity is beneficial. Vine cuttings are usually used for planting or transplants produced by bedding mother roots or from rooted cuttings. Optimum yields vary from 17.5 to 27.5 t/ha depending on the cultivar and growing conditions, while average yields are 5 t/ha in Africa, 10 t/ha in South America and 16 t/ha in Asia.

Leaves alternate, palmate, petiolate, stipulate; stipules minute; petiole 2-20 cm long, blade 3-5 lobed, 12.5-18 x 11-16 cm, lobes acute or shortly acuminate at the apex, margins entire or undulating, leaf base deeply cordate, glabrous or pubescent only on the veins below, basal veins 7-9, prominent, venation reticulate. Inflorescence a cyme formed terminally on branches and complex, possessing main and co-florescences with paracladia. The plant is monoecious and flowers are unisexual; occasionally hermaphroditic flowers occur; 10 stamens arranged in 2 distinct whorls of 5 each in a single column in the androecium and in close proximity to each other. In the gynaecium, the 3 slender styles are connate to about 2/3 of their length, dilating to a massive bifurcate stigma. Female flowers with sepals up to 18 mm long, persistent; ovary 3-locular, ellipsoid, 1.5-2 mm in diameter, style bifid. Fruit an ellipsoid capsule 2.5-3 cm long, 2-3 cm in diameter, yellow, turning black. Seeds black, 2 per cell, ellipsoid, triangular-convex, 1.5-2 x 1-1.1 cm. Pollination is by insects. The rare hermaphroditic flowers can be self-pollinating. After pollination the trilocular ellipsoid fruit is formed. The exocarp remains fleshy until the seeds are mature. In Thailand, there are 2 flowering peaks, in November and May. In permanently humid equatorial regions, flowering occurs throughout the year. Fruit development needs 90 days from flowering until seeds mature. Shrubs begin to produce at 4-5 months and reach full productivity at about 3 years. The female flowers are 4-5 times more numerous than the male ones. USES: Young leaves may be safely eaten when steamed or stewed. Cooked nuts are eaten in certain regions of Mexico. The seeds yield up to 31-37% of a valuable oil. The seed oil is renewable source of non-conventional bio-diesel. Fruit hulls and seed shells can be used as a fuel. Curcas oil contains a toxin, curcasin. The seed oil as well as seeds, leaves and bark have medicinal properties. It is grown for erosion control, as living fence and as a support for vanilla and other climbers. All plant parts can be used as a green manure. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Barbados nut, castor oil, Chinese castor oil, curcas, fig nut, physic nut, pig nut, purging nut, wild oil nut (English). FURTHER INF.: It is best adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions. It occurs in grassland-savannah and thorn forest scrub but is completely lacking from the moist Amazon region. The current distribution shows that introduction has been most successful in drier regions of the tropics. It is very tolerant and thrives under a wide range of edapho-climatic conditions. It is particularly hardy at medium altitude and in humid zones. It is not sensitive to day length. Its strength as a crop comes from its ability to grow on poor, dry sites. However, like any species that being adapted as a crop the yields are correlated with inputs. It is very drought tolerant and can withstand slight frost. It has been widely reported as resistant to pests and diseases; however due to increasing use as a monoculture for bio-diesel this is proving not to be the case. NB.: It is being classified as an invasive species in the Pacific.

FURTHER INF  Scientific synonym: Nephelium litchi. Litchi nut is a native of Southern China. It is adapted to the tropics and warm subtropics within the latitudinal ranges 13-32°N and 9-29°S. It need a chilling period for flowering with temperatures about 7-12°C or below 20-22°C depending on the cultivar. Widely flucturating day temperatures seem to contribute to vigorous vegetative growth. Bright light is essential for fruit production but shady conditions for young plants favour initial growth. It is sensitive to nitrogen and over-fertilization will slow growth and may be fatal to newly planted trees. The tree is sensitive to high winds especially in combination with low relative humidity, and it does not thrive in hot dry summers. Optimum relative humidity of wettest month is 83% and driest month 70%. In Swaziland lychee can be found at elevations between 1000-2000 m, while in southern China, it can be grown from sea level with an optimum elevation of about 300 m.

FURTHER INF  Mango originates from the Indo-Burmese monsoon region. It thrives in both tropical and subtropical areas within the latitudinal range is 30°N to 25°S. It can for non-commercial production be grown at elevations up to 1200 m and up to 600 m for commercial production. It does best with strongly marked seasons in the tropical summer rainfall regions with dry weather and moderate humidity for flowering and fruiting. High humidity, mist and heavy dew promote fungal attack, while low humidity and drying wind can cause wilting and strong winds may destroy the crop. In areas with two wet seasons flowering and fruit production may occur twice each year, but normally only one crop per year is produced. Very fertile soils with adequate supplies of water thoughout the year may result in luxuriant vegetative growth and poor cropping. The trees are drought-tolerant and do not seem to suffer from occasional flooding. According to Purseglove even shallow and impervious soils produce mangoes, but for optimal conditions the watertable should be below 2-2.5 m. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II. In the 10th year, a tree bears 400-600 fruits. A plantation of full-grown trees may produce 10-30 t/ha of fruit year. Average yields are, however often quit low e.g. in the Philippines 6 t/ha, in Peninsular Malaysia 3.5 t/ha and in Thailand 2.3 t/ha. SOURCES (M. indica L.) Sims D (pers. comm.)

Arg. cassava, tapioca plant, manihot, manioc, maniok, cassave, mandioca, macaxeira (sweet varieties), yuca, aipim (Brazil), mushu, tapioka, pondu, saka-saka, yautia 1420 DESCRIPTION: An erect shrub with an upright woody stems reaching a height of 4 m or more. The mature tuber may measure 1 m in length and weigh up to 2 kg. The cassava plant may be divided into two main parts: the shoot system, which consists of stem, leaves and reproductive structures or flowers; and the root system, which consists of feeder roots and tubers. The fleshy elongated tuberous roots or rhizomes, are very woody, only slightly thickened in wild varieties; under cultivation up to 2.5 m long and 10-15 cm in diameter, weighing up to 40 kg, averaging 4-7 kg; leaves usually deeply 3-7-parted with spatulate to linear-lanceolate acuminate lobes 7.5-15 cm long, glabrous, glaucous beneath and minutely puberulent along veins, long petioled; flowers in panicles, less than 1.2 cm long; capsules globose, about 1.2 cm across, with 6 winged angles; seeds 3 per capsule. USES: Cassava provides a major source of calories for poor families, because of its high starch content. With minimum maintenance, the farmers can dig up the starchy root of the cassava and eat it 6 months to 3 years after planting. Thus, people can cultivate cassava during times of conflict or natural disaster when no other food is available. The tubers have a high content of carbohydrates, phosphorous, iron, and calcium and are a valuable source of food. Cassava starch is used in cooking and cassava flour is used in puddings, biscuits and other confectionary. In Africa, people also eat the leaves of the cassava as a green vegetable, which provide a cheap and rich source of protein and vitamins A and B. (Young leaves are cooked like spinach). Various industries use it as a binding agent, because it is an inexpensive source of starch. Cassava starch is used in the production of paper and textiles and as monosodium glutamate (MSG), an important flavoring agent in Asian cooking. In Africa, cassava is beginning to be used in partial substitution for wheat flour, thus providing income to resource-poor farmers and saving foreign exchange for national Governments. The plant is also used in the production of adhesives, cosmetics, textiles, and paper. It is fed to livestock. Alcoholic beverages and ethanol for fuel are made from the tubers. The advantage of cassava for ethanol production is that the tubers may be stored in the ground for many months before processing; thus extending the factory window. KILLING T.: May not tolerate 7°C for prolonged periods and it is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial. Mature leaves may be harvested 50-70 days from insertion of the cuttings. The 'sweet' cassavas mature in 180-270 days, the 'bitter' in 12-18 months. Growing period 6-24 months, depending on cultivar and conditions. COMMON NAMES: Cassava, Manihot, Manioc, Tapioca, Guacomote Yuca, Cassave, Kelala, Marachini, Maravalli, Simul Alu, Ubi Singkong, Mangahazo, Ubi Kayu, Mun Sumpalung, Boodin, Kaspe, Katela, Bodin, Obi Kajoe, Poohoong Kahoy, Kamoteng, Tentu Neskok, Muk Shue, Pok Fung, Cassada, Aipi, Aipim Ubi, Ketalla, Macaxiera, Mandioca, Manoco, Ramu, Yautia. FUTHER INF.: Cassava is seldom grown above 1800 m in elevation in the tropics, maximum elevation for successfull cultivation is about 1000 m. Latitudinal range is 25°N to 30°S. Maximum tolerated slope is about 5°. The photosynthesis pathway is C3 II. Prefers moderate humidity. Tuber production is delayed and reduced in daylengths greater than 10-12 hours. Cassava is native to the countries between the Amazon region and southern Mexico. World production for 2004 was estimated at 204819995 metric tons. Production in Asia during the same period was 60492789 metric tons and in Africa 108974574. Area harvested in 2004: World 18051574 hectares Brazil 1754875 Congo 1842559 Indonesia 1255805 Nigeria 3531000 and Mozambique 1068500 hectares. Yields from small holders average 5-15 t/ha, but yields of up to 30 t/ha can be obtained. Scientists at two CGIAR research centers IITA and CIAT have developed elite varieties of cassava with improved qualities. IITA has discovered spontaneous polyploids in cassava, which are characterized by enormous vigor and variation in form and structure. Selections from triploids ""super cassava"" have doubled the yields of existing improved varieties with normal chromosome numbers. IITA has also introduced to Africa a wider genetic base for cassava improvement, focusing on materials with resistance to mites, mealybugs, cassava bacterial blight, tolerance to drought, low cyanogen potential, and good cooking quality. Together, IITA and CIAT launched a biological control campaign of the mealybug and are cooperating with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in the formulation of a global development strategy for cassava.

Numerous stems originating from crown buds; as the stems develop, axillary buds formed in lower leaf axils produce further stems, which build up a crown of basal buds at their base. The crown is the main source of stems produced after defoliation; axillary buds above ground develop into branches. It is deep-rooted, 2-4 m, or more in deep, well-drained soils. About 60-70% of total root mass is in the upper l5 cm of the soil profile. Inflorescences are compact racemes up to 40 mm, borne in axils of upper leaves; purple florets, 8 mm, typically papilionacious. Cross-pollinated by various species of bees. Seedpods are spirally coiled, glabrous or pubescent; pods turn from green to brown as they mature, and contain 2-5 kidney-shaped, yellow or brown seeds. A proportion of the seeds are hard, probably inversely related to temperature during seed set. USES: It is one of the highest yielding forage legumes and requires deep, well-drained fertile soils to maximize its potential. The inherent growth characteristics and good yield response to infrequent cutting make lucerne a highly suitable species for conservation as hay or silage. It is mainly grown as a fodder crop. Chlorophyll is extracted from the leaves and the flowers are a source of honey. It is grow as a cover crop to reduce erosion. It is a nitrogen fixer and estimates of annual rates range from 85 to 360 kg N/ha with a wide variation among sites. It can be grown in combination with maize for silage. Its fibers can be used in the manufacture of paper. It has medicinal properties and a yellow dye and trypsin inhibitors can be extracted from the seeds. It is compatible with non-aggressive grasses. KILLING T.: 0 C during early growth and it is known to survive temperatures of ˆ25 C in Alaska and above 50 C in California. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, lasting up to six years, but usually three to four years, growing 100-365 days per year. Spring to autumn, but main flush of growth in late spring/early summer. It is variable in winter dormancy. Winter-hardy types suited to cold regions have a longer dormancy period and shorter growing season than the less winter-hardy types suited to warm temperate regions.

FURTHER INF.: Widely distributed in temperate zones of the world, e.g. USA, southern Canada, Europe, China, southern Latin America and South Africa. The autotetraploid alfalfa originated from a diploid species, native to an area south of the Black and Caspian Seas. Alfalfa can be found up to 4000 m in elevation in Bolivia, but normally up to about 2400 m. In warm climates relative humidity should be low; hot and humid conditions promote diseases. The seed needs to be inoculated with an effective strain of Rhizobium meliloti, which requires a soil pH of at least 6.0. Lime-coated, inoculated seed has been used with success on more acid soils. More drought tolerant than other forage legumes such as red clover or birds foot trefoil. Deep-rooting ability is an important factor in drought tolerance and any adverse soil physical or chemical conditions, which restrict root growth will reduce drought tolerance. Compared with many forage species lucerne is an efficient user of water supply largely as a result of its deep taproot system. During severe drought, plants become dormant but resume growth when moisture becomes available Dry matter yields may be 10-20 t/ha. Seed yields vary from 50 to 750 kg/ha. Sims D (pers. comm.)

51e1e105-a20e-446d-a401-f6005e142771,Olea europaea,"L. Magnoliopsida:Asteridae:Scrophulariales:Oleaceae olive, ulivo 1553 DESCRIPTION: It is a small, evergreen tree, averaging 12 m or more in height but kept to 6m with regular pruning. The root system is relatively shallow, and will not tolerate waterlogged soils. It has many thin branches with opposite branchlets and shortly-stalked, opposite, lanceolate leaves about 6 cm long, acute, entire and smooth, pale green above and silvery below. The bark is pale grey and the flowers numerous, small and creamy white in colour and are largely hidden by the evergreen leaves and grow on a long stem arising from the leaf axils. The olive produces two kinds of flowers: a perfect flower containing both male and female parts, and a staminate flower with stamens only. The flowers are largely wind pollinated with most olive varieties being self-pollinating, although fruit set is usually improved by cross-pollination with other varieties. There are self-incompatible varieties that do not set fruit without other varieties nearby, and there are varieties that are incompatible with certain others. Incompatibility can also occur for environmental reasons such as high temperatures. The dark purple fruit is a drupe about 2 cm long, ovoid and often pointed, the fleshy part filled with oil. The pulp is bitter, due to tannin in the raw fruit, and contains up to 20% oil. The thick, bony stone has a blunt keel down one side. It contains a single seed. The seeds of a few varieties are green when ripe and some turn a shade of copper brown. The cultivars vary considerably in size, shape, oil-content and flavor. The shapes range from almost round to oval or elongated with pointed ends. The trees reach bearing age in about 4 years. USES: Olive oil, an unsaturated fat, has recently become more valued for its health benefits; the oil component includes unsaturated fatty acid (70% to 80% oleic acid and 7% to 12% linoleic acid), and small amounts of polyphenols, tocopherols, sterols, and many aromatic compounds. The ripe fruits are pressed to extract the oil, the methods varying in different countries. Virgin oil, greenish in tint, is obtained by pressing crushed fruit in coarse bags and skimming the oil from the tubs of water through which it is conducted. The cake left in the bags is broken up, moistened, and repressed. For use as a dessert fruit the unripe olives are steeped in water to reduce their bitterness. Olive soap is made from olive oil and sodium hydroxide. The beautifully veined wood not only takes a fine polish, but is faintly fragrant, and is much valued for small cabinetwork. It was in olden days carved into statues of gods. The leaves are astringent and antiseptic. Both leaves and bark have valuable febrifugal qualities. The oil is a nourishing demulcent and laxative. Externally, it relieves pruritis, the effects of stings or burns, and is a good vehicle for liniments. With alcohol it is a good hair-tonic. As a lubricant it is valuable in skin, muscular, joint, kidney and chest complaints, or abdominal chill, typhoid and scarlet fevers, plague and dropsies. It is often used in enemas. It is the best fat for cooking, and a valuable article of diet for both sick and healthy of all ages. It can easily be taken with milk, orange or lemon juice, etc. The high position held by the Olive tree in ancient as in modern days may be realized when it is remembered that Moses exempted from military service men who would work at its cultivation, and that in Scriptural and classical writings the oil is mentioned as a symbol of goodness and purity, and the tree as representing peace and happiness. The oil, in addition to its wide use in diet, was burnt in the sacred lamps of temples, while the victor in the Olympic games was crowned with its leaves. KILLING T.: It is injured when temperatures fall below -10 degrees C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial: olives are long-lived with a life expectancy of 500 years. The trees are also tenacious, easily sprouting back even when chopped to the ground. FURTHER INF.: The olive is native to the Mediterranean region, tropical and central Asia and various parts of Africa. The olive has a history almost as long as that of Western civilization, its development being one of civilized man's first accomplishments. At a site in Spain, carbon dating has shown olive seed found there to be eight thousand years old. O. europaea may have been cultivated independently in two places, Crete and Syria. Archaeological evidence suggests that olives were being grown in Crete as long ago as 2,500 B.C. From Crete and Syria olives spread to Greece, Rome and other parts of the Mediterranean area. Olives are also grown commercially in California, Australia and South Africa. Proper pruning is important for the olive. Pruning both regulates production and shapes the tree for easier harvest. The trees can withstand radical pruning, so it is relatively easy to keep them at a desired height. The problem of alternate bearing can also be avoided with careful pruning every year. It should be kept in mind that the olive never bears fruit in the same place twice, and usually bears on the previous year's growth. For a single trunk, prune suckers and any branches growing below the point where branching is desired. Prune flowering branches in early summer to prevent olives from forming. Olive trees can also be pruned to espaliers. None of the cultivated varieties can be propagated by seed. Seed propagated trees revert to the original small-fruited wild variety. The seedlings can, of course, be grafted or chip budded with material from desired cultivars. The variety of an olive tree can also be changed by bark grafting or top working. Another method of propagation is transplanting suckers that grow at the base of mature trees. However, these would have to be grafted if the suckers grew from the seedling rootstock. A commonly practiced method is propagation from cuttings. Thirty-thirty five cm long, two-seven cm wide cuttings from the two-year old wood of a mature tree is treated with a rooting hormone, planted in a light-rooting medium and kept moist. Trees grown from such cuttings can be further grafted with wood from another cultivar. Cutting grown trees bear fruit in about four years. The type of harvest depends upon fruit use. Oil olives are harvested by hand or by mechanically shaking the tree. Those for pickling must still be harvested by hand as the fruit bruises easily. Olives will grow well on almost any well-drained soil up to pH 8.5 and are tolerant of mild saline conditions. Because the olive has fewer natural enemies than other crops, and because the oil in olives retains the odor of chemical treatments, the olive is one of the least sprayed crops. It requires a long, hot growing season to properly ripen the fruit, no late spring frosts to kill the blossoms and sufficient winter chill to insure fruit set. Hot, dry winds may be harmful during the period when the flowers are open and the young fruits are setting. The trees survive and fruit well even with considerable neglect. The olive tree has a wide range of adaptability. It requires a mild climate with warm summers and cold winters. The tree requires substantial chilling for good fruiting. Olive is considered a drought-resistant species because it thrives in areas where water stress is frequent. Olives are wind pollinated, thus flowering during rain; high temperatures and dry wind conditions are deleterious to good fruit set. Mature olive trees produce huge numbers of flowers, but the fruit set is normally below 5%. Most olive cultivars will set some fruit in a mono-cultivar culture. However, they benefit greatly from cross-pollination. Olives are picked late in autumn or winter, as the oil content and fruit characteristics change with ripening.

Depending on the degree of photosensitivity its growth duration may range from 60 to more than 200 days. It has round; jointed culm with long narrow leaves. The culm terminates in an inflorescence called a panicle. The height of the culm may vary from 20 cm to over 5 m in some deep-water rice exhibiting excellent internode elongation ability. Three types of roots are recognized in rice e.g. seminal roots, mesocotyl roots and nodal or adventitious roots. Seminal roots grow out of radicle and are temporary in nature. The radicle emerges after germination. It elongates to about 15 cm and remains functional up to seventh leaf stage. Mesocotyl roots emerge from the axis between the node of the coleoptile and base of radicle. Mesocotyl roots do not grow under normal circumstances. However, under deep seeding conditions emergence of mesocotyl roots are promoted. The rice root system is essentially adventitious, fibrous and arises from the compressed basal nodes. Roots that develop directly from the nodes are called primary roots. Primary roots produce branched secondary roots, which in turn give rise to tertiary roots and so on. The roots, which develop from nodes below the soil surface, are called crown roots and roots that develop from nodes above the soil surface are referred to as nodal roots. Nodal roots are often found in rice cultivars growing at water depth above 80 cm. Most rice varieties reach a maximum depth of 1 m or deeper in soft upland soils. In flooded soils, however rice roots seldom exceed a depth of 40 cm. Aerobic root environments, as in case of upland rice, promote development of root hairs whereas anaerobic condition as in flooded rice, retard the development of root hairs. The rice stem is known as culm. The culm is made up of a series of nodes and internodes. The node bears a leaf and in its axil between the sheath pulvinus and nodal septum a bud which may grow into a tiller. The region between two nodes is called an internode. Only a few internodes elongate. The number of internodes, which elongate ranges from 3-8. An internode whose length exceeds 5mm is usually considered as elongated. The internodes of a culm vary in length usually increasing from the lower to the upper ones. The lower internodes are compressed into a solid section. The number of nodes varies from 13 to 16 with only the upper 4 or 5 separated by long inter-nodes. Under rapid increases in water level, some deep-water rice varieties the lower inter-node can also elongate in length by over 30 cm each. The plant height is an inherited character. The plant height of the modern high yielding varieties may vary from 90 to 110 cm. with the dwarfing gene as compared to traditional tall varieties where the plant height may vary from 120 to 150 or more. The plant height in deep-water varieties with inter-node elongation ability may reach 5 m. under certain situation. A branch of the plant bearing the root, culm leaves and with or without a panicle is called a tiller. Tillers develop from leaf axils at each un-elongated node of the main shoot or from tillers during vegetative growth in an alternate order. On the culm the coleoptile and the first leaf do not produce tillers. Tillering starts from the second leaf when the fifth leaf on the main culm emerges. The primary tillers originate from the lower most nodes and give to secondary tillers, which in turn give rise to tertiary tillers. Tillering ability is a varietal character. The tall traditional varieties are usually low tillering and spreading while the modern high yielding varieties (HYV) have high tillering ability and are compact. In high tillering varieties all the tillers are not productive. Numerous environmental factors also affect tillering ability such as spacing, light, nutrient supply and cultural practices. The leaves arise from the node and are borne at an angle in an alternate phyllotaxy. Varieties differ in leaf number. A typical rice leaf consists of leaf sheath, auricle, ligule, leaf lamina or blade. The leaf sheath is continuous with the leaf blade. It encloses the culm above the node in varying length, form and tightness. The swelling at the base the leaf sheath is called pulvinus. It is above the nodal septum. The expanded portion of the leaf is called the leaf lamina or leaf blade. It has parallel venation. The prominent ridge on the lower surface is called the mid-rib. At the junction of the leaf blade and leaf sheath on the inside there are two triangular and membranous structures called ligules. On either side, there is a pair of hairy sickle shaped auricles. The white band around the junction between the blade and sheath is called the collar. The first rudimentary leaf at the base of the main culm is bladeless and two keeled bract. It is called the prophyllum. The margins of the prophyllum clasp the young tiller. Prophyllum is also present between each secondary and it's tertiary tiller. The upper most leaf below the panicle is called the flag or boot leaf. The traditional tall varieties have long droopy leaves, whereas the semi-dwarf modern HYVs have short, small and erect leaves. The floral organs of rice plants are modified shoots. The terminal internode bears the determinate inflorescence; called the panicle that bears spikelets. Panicle: The panicle consists of the panicle base, axis, primary and secondary branches, pedicel, rudimentary glumes and spikelets. The panicle axis extends from the panicle base to the apex interspersed with 8-10 nodes at two to 4 cm apart. Panicle branching is racemose. Primary branches develop from the nodes. Secondary branches develop from the primary branches. Pedicels develop from the nodes of primary and secondary branches, which bear the spikelets. The spikelet of rice consists of three flowers, two of which are reduced, in development. The enlarged cup like apex of the pedicle is homologous with a pair of glumes and called rudimentary glumes. The spikelet consists of a minute axis called rachilla, a pair of sterile lemmas glumes, lemma, palea and the flower. The lemma, palea and the included flower are together known as the floret. The sterile lemmas, lemma and palea are also called bracts. Lemma is the five-nerved keel shaped bracts, which partly encloses the palea. The tip of the lemma and palea is known as apiculus. The filiform extension of the keel of the lemma is called awn. Palea is a three-nerved bract, which fits closely to the lemma. The flower consists of six stamens and a pistil. Each stamen is composed of two celled versatile anthers borne on slender filaments. The pistil consists of an ovary with one ovule, short style and bifurcate plumose (hairy) stigma. Two fleshy, transparent structures located at the base of the flower, adnate to palea are called lodicules. Lodicules represent the perianth (calyx and corolla). The rice fruit is a caryopsis with a single seed fused to the ripened ovary wall, pericarp. Lemma and palea enclose the caryopsis. The rice grain is the ripened ovary with lemma, palea, rachilla sterile lemmas. The rice grain is also known as rough rice. The Lemma, palea, sterile lemmas, rachilla and the awn whenever present constitute the hull or husk. Dehulled rice grain is called brown rice. The caryopsis is enclosed by the pericarp. Next to the pericarp there are two layers of cells representing the remains of the integuments, or seed coat. The bulk of the caryopsis is the starchy endosperm. An aleurone layer encloses the endosperm, which lies below the tegmen. The embryo is located on the ventral side of the caryopsis. The embryo consists of plumule, mesocotyl, radicle, epiblast and scutellum. The plumule (embryonic leaves) is enclosed by the coleoptile, whereas the radicle (embryonic root) is ensheathed by coleorhiza. The embryonic axis mesocotyl is bounded on the inner side by scutellum adhering to the endosperm and on the outer side by the aleurone layer. The vascular trace fused with the lateral part of the scutellum is called the epiblast. USES: Raw or parboiled milled rice is cooked and used as food. It forms the main course of the meals for millions of people in Asia and else where. Many processed foods such as popped or puffed rice products are produced from brown rice or parboiled rice for use as breakfast cereals and snack foods. Beer, wine and spirits can be produced from the grain. Rice is mainly grown for food but it is also used in cosmetics, laundering starch, and textiles. An oil is produced and used as cooking and salad oil, for soap manufacture and it is made into a plastic packaging material. Husks are used as fuel, as an addition to concrete, for making hardboard and as an abrasive. The harvesting of rice produces straw as a by-product. Rice straw has poor palatability, bulkiness, low digestibility, low protein, high lignin and high silica contents. It is the most common feed ingredient for cattle in many developing countries in Asia and Pacific region, particularly in Bangladesh, India, Myanamar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Urea-treated rice straw as cattle feed is popular in Bangladesh. Rice straw is for making and repairing thatched houses in Bangladesh, Nepal and India. It is used for construction of grain storage structures, ropes, packaging material and bags in India. It is also used as fuel in Vietnam. In China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan rice straw is used in the production of paper. The chief by-products produced during milling are husks, bran and Œbrokens‚. Husks are used as domestic fuel in many countries. In Myanmar rice husks are used as fuel for the operation of rice mills, for parboiling in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar Nepal and Sri Lanka, in China for the production of steam or gas for power generation. Rice husks are also used as packaging and insulation material. Although rice husk exhibits a low protein and high fiber content, they are used as animal feed in Bangladesh, China and India. Rice husks on burning produce 20 % (by weight) of ash containing 90% silica. In India, rice husk ash is fillet in the rubber industry and in the steel industry as an insulating material. Rice bran is highly nutritious. It contents lipids, protein, minerals and vitamins. Because of its nutritional value, it is used as a feed for poultry and livestock. Refined bran oil is utilized as a salad oil as well as for cooking. Crude bran oil is used in the production of soap. In China oryzanol is extracted from crude bran oil, which has pharmaceutical use. De-oiled rice bran is used to for the commercial extraction of phytin. Rice brokens have a variety of uses such as animal feed, making rice flour and malt sugar for breweries. It is used in a variety of ways to prepare processed rice based food products. The seed has nutrient, remineralizing, antidiarrhoeic and emollient properties and administration is as decoction and powder. KILLING T.: Growth arrested below 10°C; rice exhibits little or no frost tolerance. GROWING PERIOD:  Annual grass, wetland types growing 80-150 days, while floating rice may require 180-200 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: Rice, riz, arroz, reis, ris, arishi, arroz, byeo, cau, chawal, dao, dhan. FURTHER INF.: Rice is grown in four ecosystems, which are broadly defined on the basis of water regimes. The ecosystems are irrigated, rain-fed lowland, upland and flood-prone, which cover 55, 25, 13 and 7% of the world's rice area respectively and account for 76, 17, 4 and 3% of the world's current rice production. The cultivation of indica is confined to areas between 0° and 25° latitude, it is seldom grown above 1200 m in elevation and performs best below 600m. They are hardy, resistant to diseases and tolerate unfavourable growing conditions. Rice can be grown very successfully in areas of low humidity and rainfall if there is adequate water available for irrigation but rice prefers medium to high humidity. The genetic diversity of O. sativa is most prevalent in the area extending over Asam, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Yunnan, China. The genus Oryza belongs to sub-family Oryzoideae of family Poaceae (Gramineae). It has two cultivated species of rice, Oryza sativa L., and Oryza glaberrima Steud. Both the cultivated species of rice are diploid (2n=24 chromosomes). The site of rice (O. sativa L.) domestication, whether one or many is debatable. Hybrid rice yields on an average 6.6 tons/ha compared with 5 tons/ha for conventional rice varieties. Sims D (pers. comm.)

FURTHER INF  Scientific synonyms: P. limensis, P. inamoenus. Lima bean is indigenous to Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. Many cultivars are in tropical areas best grown as elevations between 900-2800 m, but some will give resonable yields at sea level. Lima bean contains day-neutral genotypes that flower in daylengths of 9-18 hours and short-day types that require critical daylength of 11-12.3 hours for flowering. It require a dry period for the seeds to mature and heavy rainfall at the flowering period may reduce fertilization. Lima bean favours sloping well-drained areas and many varieties need trellising. Photosynthesis pathway C3. Optimum yield of fresh beans is 2-8 t/ha. In the tropics average production of dry seed is 1-1.5 t/ha. Yields of dry seed may reach 2-2.5 t/ha for bush types and 3-4 t/ha from climbing types.

FURTHER INF  Common bean is probably native to tropical South America. It can be found at elevations from sea level to 3000 m, most cultivars thrives between 600 and 2000 m, but cultivars for tropical sea level exist. Popping beans are grown between 1800 and 3000 m in the Andean mountains. Common bean require medium to high humidity especially at flowering, but to high humidity will, like poor drainage, generally result in disease problems. Hail can cause serious defoliation and loss of the crop. For harvesting, drying and threshing of the beans dry weather is required. Photosynthesis pathway C3. To acid soils should be avoided since the reduce the activity of the Rhizobium nitrogen fixing bacteria. Common bean is not as efficient as many other legumes in utilizing the nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria which inhabit the root system. The average yield of dried beans is 0.5-1.5 t/ha, but yields up to 2.8-5 t/ha have been reported. Yields of green pods of up to 5-7.5 t/ha have been reported. SOURCES (P. vulgaris L.)

USES  The fruits are usually eaten fresh or dried. Date pulp is a good source of calcium, phosphorous, and carbohydrates. Palm trunks can be tapped for a sap taht is made into palm wine. Palm leaves have been used as thatch and fiber. KILLING T  Leaves may tolerate -4 to -6°C and the tree -15°C. GROWING PERIOD  Perennial. Begin fruiting within 2-4 years and normally reach full production at 5-8 years, (Rice; 8-10 years) but productivity may increase up to 9-15 years. Yields decline after 40-50 years, but the tree will continue to produce up to about 75 years. COMMON NAMES  Date, Palmier dattier, Datilera, Dattelpalme, Khajur, Khaji, Thinbaw thinbaung, Tamareira, Palmera, Datilera. FURTHER INF  The tree transpires large quantities of moisture and the amount of available rainfall is often little, or entire absent in the production areas. The water requirement of the palm must be provided for by ground water (the roots of the tree can reach 2-6 m deep) or by irrigation. Irrigation is needed about every 14 days in the summer and 20-30 days in the winter. The water requirement of the palms is about 10000-50000 m3/ha per year, or 1.5 m3 per palm per week as an average over the year. Relative humidity should be between 40 and 50% during ripening time. Rain during flowering can hinder the pollination and rain during the fruit development can lead to bursting and dacay of the fruit. An average well-managed palm can produce about 60-70 kg of fresh dates per year. The palm can be grown at elevations between sea level and 1500 m. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.

Pinopsida:Pinaceae loblolly pine, Rosemary pine, oldfield pine, black slash pine, cornstalk pine, longshucks pine, Indian pine, frankincense pine 1708 DESCRIPTION: It is an evergreen, coniferous tree typically reaching 25-30 m in height but may reach up to 50 m. The crown is broadly conical and dense. USE: The timber is used for furniture, pulpwood, plywood, composite boards, posts, poles, pilings, crates, boxes, pallets. The tree is also planted to stabilize eroded or damaged soils. It can be used for shade or ornamental trees, as well as bark mulch. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Loblolly pine. FURTHER INF: The term ""loblolly"" literally means ""mudhole"" which can be used to describe the wet soil conditions on which this tree occurs naturally. Their best growth is on moderately acid soils in areas of poor surface drainage which consists of a thick, medium-textured surface layer and fine-textured subsoil. They do not grow well, however, on very wet or water-logged sites, or in areas with shallow or eroded soils. The tree grows best in moist sites, but it can grow in drier areas and compete with other pines. It is mostly found on Ultisol soils, although small areas of Entisols, Spodosols, and Alfisols are scattered throughout its range. Productivity is sensitive to soil fertility; if poorly drained soils have low fertility, usually there is a decrease in productivity. Also, the presence of a spodic horizon along the root zone causes a decline in productivity. This tree is planted on Histosols following artificial drainage and site preparation. It can be found at elevations from 1300 to 2700 m. The latitudinal range of natural occurrence is 28-39°N. The tree is frost resistant. Annual wood production potential is 12-30 m3/ha.

Leaves imparipinnate, shiny; young leaves pinkish red, mature leaves glossy, deep green; leaflets 5-9, the terminal leaflet larger than the others; stipels none; stipules caducous. Flowers fragrant, white to pinkish, paired along rachis in axillary, pendent, long racemes or panicles; calyx campanulate or cup-shaped, truncate, short-dentate, lowermost lobe sometimes longer; standard suborbicular, broad, usually with 2 inflexed, basal ears, thinly silky-haired outside; wings oblique, long, somewhat adherent to the obtuse keel; keel petals coherent at apex; stamens monadelphous, vexillary stamen free at the base but joined with others into a closed tube; ovary subsessile to short-stalked, pubescent; ovules 2, rarely 3; style filiform, upper half incurved, glabrous; stigma small, terminal. Pod short stalked, oblique-oblong, flat, smooth, thickly leathery to sub-woody, indehiscent, 1-seeded; seed thick, reniform. USES: As an ornamental in gardens and along avenues and roadsides, for its fragrant Wisteria-like flowers, and as a host plant for lac insects. Flowers are considered a good source of pollen for honeybees in India and they yield adequate nectar. With a calorific value of 4 600 kcal/kg, pongam is commonly used as a fuel wood. A preferred species for controlled soil erosion and binding sand dunes because of its extensive network of lateral roots. Incorporation of leaves and the press cake into soils improves fertility. The seeds contain pongam oil, a bitter, red brown, thick, non-drying, nonedible oil, 27-36% by weight, which is used for tanning leather, soap, as a liniment to treat scabies, herpes, and rheumatism and as an illuminating oil. The seed oil is under investigation as a renewable source of bio-diesel. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. FURTHER INF.: It is native to humid and sub-tropic environments and is common along waterways or seashores, with its roots in fresh or saltwater. It is reported as native to Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand and exotic in Australia, China, Egypt, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tonga and the United States of America. It occurs naturally in lowland forest on limestone and rocky coral outcrops on the coast, along the edges of mangrove forest and along tidal streams and rivers. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 1200 m. In its natural habitat, the species tolerates a wide temperature range. Mature trees withstand light frost and temperatures of up to 50°C. Reported temperature range for growth is 10-50°C with the optimum between 16-38°C. It is drought resistant and well adapted to adverse climatic conditions; prolonged drought may however kill seedlings. Reported annual rainfall range for growth is 400-2500 mm with the optimum between 500-2000 mm. In addition to rain, trees require a dry season of 2-6 months. It is a shade bearer and can grow under the shade of other trees, it is, however, not a shade demander and grows well even with full overhead light. It is well adapted to adverse soil moisture conditions and waterlogging. It can grow on most soil types but best growth is found on deep well-drained sandy loams with assured moisture, it will however also grow on sandy soils and heavy swelling clay soils. It does not do well on dry sands. It is very tolerant of saline conditions and alkalinity. Reported soil pH range for growth is 6-9 with the optimum between 6.5-8.5. Nodulation is reported on pongam. In nurseries and fields the presence of nodules on un-inoculated pongam seedlings is common. Therefore, this species may not be specific in its Rhizobium strain requirement. It nodulates and fixes atmospheric nitrogen with Rhizobium of the cowpea group. Propagation methods: Natural reproduction is profuse by seed and common by root suckers. Spontaneous seedlings and root suckers are produced and may cause serious weed problems. Direct sowing is common and most successful. Seeds require no pre-treatment and germinate within 7 days to 1 month of sowing. Germination is hypogeal and the radicle develops quickly before the plumule emerges. In the nursery, it can be planted at a close spacing, as young plants tolerate shade well; in India a spacing of 7.5 x 15 cm is recommended. Seedlings attain a height of 25-30 cm in their first growing season. Transplanting to the field should occur at the beginning of the next rainy season when seedlings are about 60 cm in height. Seedlings have large root systems and soil should be retained around the roots during transplanting. Easily established by direct seeding or by planting nursery-raised seedlings or stump cuttings of 1-2 cm root-collar diameter. Propagation by branch cuttings and root suckers is also possible. Tree Management: Seedling survival and growth benefit from annual weed control for the first 3 years after transplanting. Growth of young trees is fairly slow; a growth of 1.3 m in height and 0.4 cm in diameter in 13 months was recorded in India. Trees coppice well and can also be pollarded. When planted as a shade or ornamental tree, pruning may be necessary to obtain a trunk of appropriate height. The spacing adopted in avenue planting is about 8 m between plants. In block plantings, the spacing can range from 2 x 2 m to 5 x 5 m. Individual trees yield 9-90 kg of pods annually, (8-24 kg of seeds). The lateral spread of roots on this species, about 9 m in 18 years, is greater than most other species; moreover it produces root suckers profusely. Because of these characteristics, pongam is usually unsuitable for agro-forestry and has the potential to become a weed if not managed carefully; it also attracts many pests and diseases.",http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=1781

f6fab6dc-23c8-4865-98af-4360e68d0a8d,Ricinus communis,"L. Magnoliopsida:Dilleniidae:Euphorbiales:Euphorbiaceae castor oil plant, bele ni vavalagi, lama papalagi, castor bean, gullo, kobo (Galinya), kasterolieboom 1866 DESCRIPTION: Castor in tropical countries is an erect herbaceous shrub or a small plant 6-10 m tall; its longevity is 8-12 years. In moderate climates this plant has a woody stem 0.5-4 m tall and it dies during autumn due to frosts or as a result of desiccation. The taproot penetrates the soil up to 1.5-3 m, or in the case of a crop of many years standing, up to 5-6 m. Most important are the secondary lateral roots that spread in the ploughed layer up to 1 m. If there is insufficient moisture the root grows deep, with little lateral spreading, whereupon their development leads to growth of the above ground mass. The stems are succulent, herbaceous, very variable in all aspects - 7.5-15 cm in diameter. Its stem is geniculate, thick, branching and terminates with a raceme spike. In some of the varieties grown in Russia, the stem has from 5 to 12 nodes and the same number of leaves at a 30-100 cm height of stem, and the length of the internode is 6-10 cm. The dwarf varieties have short (1.5-3 cm) internodes. The castor plant is well foliated. Leaves are glabrous and alternate on the basis of a 2/5 layout, except the first two opposite leaves. They are 10-16 cm wide, smooth, rarely wrinkled and have stipules at the base of their long (20-50 cm) glandular petioles. They are palmate - parted in 7-9 lanceolate dentate lobes - the middle one being the largest. It has monoecious flowers - male and female flowers are on the same plant and form clusters (racemes) 10-40 cm long in terminal pannicles. The tubular perianth is 5-lobed. They are numerous in long inflorescences, petals absent in both sexes (male and female flowers are apetalous), sepals 3-5, greenish; stamens numerous, 5-10 mm long; ovary superior, 3-celled with a short style and 3-6 stigmas. The upper fruit syncarp is a spherical or elongated dehiscent, fragile 3-sectioned dry capsule 2.5 cm in diameter, 1-3.5 cm long with a wrinkled or smooth surface. It is borne on an elongated pedicel, and is often spiny. The colour of the ripening capsules is green, yellow, brown, red, crimson or violet; dried ones are often grey or brown. The seed of castor is nut-oval, tick-like, egg-shaped, rarely spherical or elongated in form, 0.8-3 cm long, 0.6-1.5 cm wide and 0.4-1.0 cm thick. It is carunculate. The seeds are covered by a dense, shiny but fragile hull of two colours. The background is dark, usually dark-gray, red or brown, rarely black or white; there are mosaic spots of various dimensions and colors; pink, white-brown, red, black. The pattern varying from fine to coarse, veined or finely dotted to large splotches. The integument and cotyledons are flat and slender. There are 1,000 to 11,000 seeds per kg; commercial varieties having 2,200 to 3,200 per kg. It is a C3 pathway plant but with restricted assimilation of CO . USES: The seeds yield a water-resistant fast-drying, non-yellowing oil, used mainly in industry and medicines. The oil is included in fuel mixtures for precision engines. Dehydrated oil is an excellent drying agent that compares favourably with tung oil and is used in paints and varnishes and as a basic ingredient in emollient soaps. It is used in coating fabrics and other protective coverings, in the manufacture of high-grade lubricants, transparent typewriter and printing inks, in textile dyeing (when converted into sulphonated castor oil or turkey-red oil, for dyeing cotton fabrics with alizarine) and in leather preservation. It is also used for plastics, ointments, and cosmetics. The seed has purgative and emollient properties and administration is as oil, capsules, enema, ointment and suppositories. Pharmacological compounds to combat hair-loss usually contain castor oil and it has an antidandruff effect. The expressed oil cakes are used as fertilizer and detoxified meal can be fed to livestock; although it is highly toxic due to its ricin (that has been used as a poison), a method of detoxicating the meal has now been found, so that it can safely be fed to livestock. Plant stems are made into paper and wallboard. NB.: The seeds must never be swallowed: 5-6 will kill a child, 10 will kill an adult - there is no specific antidote. KILLING T.: During the rest period it is -2 C. It does not tolerate low temperatures during the growing period. GROWING PERIOD: Grown as an annual in temperate regions, and as a short-lived perennial under subtropical and tropical conditions. Growing period is 140-160 days for early cultivars, and 170-210 days for late cultivars. COMMON NAMES: Castor, Castorbean, Ricin, Ricino. FURTHER INF.: The name Ricinus is a Latin word for tick; the seed is so named because it has markings and a bump at the end, that resemble certain ticks. Castor perform best with a relative humidity of 30-60 %, ideally humidity should be higher during vegetative growth and lower during the period of maturity and harvest. To high humidity can lead to increased insect problems. Castor can be cultivated between 40°S and 52°N and it can be grown from sea-level up to 1500-3000 m in elevation, but it is best grown between 300-1800 m. The photosynthesis pathway C3 II. The species is most probably indigenous to North-East Africa, especially Ethiopia. 1 ton of seed remove about 30 kg N, 5 kg P, 12 kg K, and 4 kg Ca, and 3 kg Mg from the field. Unbalanced N-fertilizer encourages the growth of foliage at the expense of seed formation. The global average yield is 0.75 t/ha, in Africa 0.5 t/ha but in the United States 3.0 t/ha are not exceptional under irrigation. The seeds of the plant are poisonous, eating a single seed may cause serious illness and the leaves should not be used as forage. Sims D (pers. comm.)

d50a75e4-447d-4042-9c3c-e4f136fb5dda,Saccharum officinarum,"L. Liliopsida:Commelinidae:Cyperales:Gramineae sugarcane, sugar cane, canna da zucchero, caña de azúcar, cana de acucar, Zuckerrohr, suikerriet, shenkora, dovu, dovu buta, dovu vico, malaqele, kabakabavale, ganna, te kaikawewe (Kiribati), to, tolo (Samoa, Tuvalu), peqi (Simbo), suti (Roviana), suga 1884 DESCRIPTION: The sugar cane plant is a large perennial tropical grass with thick stems that may grow up to 2-3 meters tall, but with extended growing periods it can become much taller. The roots of the cane plant develop from the growth ring on the original planting piece and also from the new shoots that develop. The majority of the roots are thin and superficial with four fifths of the roots commonly found in the top 25-50 cm. Thicker roots will penetrate to depths of four meters or more. The stem of sugarcane is economically the most important plant part. The stems are made up of nodal units, which include the node and the internode. The internal part of the stem is largely parenchyma interspersed with vascular bundles. The parenchyma cells accumulate sugar. Each node subtends a leaf with an axillary bud at the base of the leaf sheath. The individual shoots of sugarcane show strong apical dominance; however, when this is broken the axillary buds develop into new shoots. Contrary to most grasses, the stem is not hollow but filled, as in maize and sorghum. In a magnified cross section it presents the typical aspect of a monocotyledon. Inside the rind tissue and within the vascular bundle is the delicate parenchyma that contains the sucrose-rich plasma. The leaves of sugarcane are distributed alternately on the stem and comprise the leaf sheath and the leaf blade or lamina. The leaf sheath wraps closely round the stem and in some varieties clings to the stem long after the leaf blade and the sheath have senesced. On some varieties the sheath ruptures naturally where it joins the node and the leaves fall naturally. Leaves and sheaths of some varieties are covered with a large number of siliceous hairs. These hairs penetrate the skin of cane cutters and are most unpleasant; hence cane cutters prefer varieties with few hairs or burnt cane. The terminal meristem of the cane shoot turns reproductive about 3 months before the emergence of the flower. The flowers of cane are of no commercial significance per se, and many varietal selection programs are directed towards the elimination of flowering in commercial fields. Flowering is, however, of great importance in breeding programs, many of which use artificial methods to stimulate flowering. USES: It provides raw sugar. Important by-products are bagasse, molasses, filter mud cakes, and cane wax. Bagasse is residue used as fuel, livestock feed, and for the manufacture of fiberboard, paper pulp, plastic, furfural, and cellulose. Molasses are fed to livestock, used for industrial purposes, in confectionary, and it is the source of industrial alcohol as well as rum and gin. Filter mud cakes are used as fertilizer. Cane wax is used in the production of furniture, shoe, and leather polishes, electrical insulating material, and waxed paper. Brazil is a major grower of sugarcane, which is used to produce sugar and provide the ethanol used in making gasoline-ethanol blends (gasohol) for transportation fuel. KILLING T.: Seedlings may not tolerate -7 to -12°C, and the mature plant not -2°C. Long-term exposure to temperatures below 10°C may also be lethal. When temperatures reach 0°C leaves become chlorotic, at about -3°C young plants turn brown and the terminal buds and leaves of mature cane die, at -5.5°C the millable stem dies. When the temperature reaches -11.5°C the whole plant dies in susceptible clones. There are large varietal differences in cold tolerance and susceptibility to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, growing from 7-24 months, usually 14-18 months, with an additional 12 months for the ratoon crop. It is normally grown as a perennial crop in which several ratoons are taken. COMMON NAMES: Sugarcane, Nobel cane, Canne a sucre, Cana de azucar, Zuckerrohr. FURTHER INF.: For ripening relative low temperatures in the range of 10-20°C and dry weather are desirable. Sugarcane is photoperiod sensitive. Flowering is induced by a continuous reduction in day length of as little as 1 minute per day from long days of about 13 hours. Most commercial sugarcane is grown between 35°N and S in the tropics usually at altitudes from sea level to 1600 m. Nobel canes are native to islands in the South Pacific, most probably New Guinea. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III. Cane us is considered to be moderately tolerant to saline soil conditions; electrical conductivity of the soil solution should be less than 2 d S m-1 with a threshold value of 4 d S m-1. In Khuzestan, Iran, cane is grown on soils which have been desalinated from an EC of 30 to 3 dS/m-1. Cane is relatively tolerant of acid soils with large areas of cane in Latin America grown on the acid oxisols and utisols. It prefers moderate to high humidity and high winds cause damage and lower yields. Where sugarcane is grown under irrigation in Africa, a yield of 100-150 tons of cane/ha is obtained from the plant crop and 60-90 tons from the first ratoon crop. Under rain-fed conditions, about half of the above mentioned yield is obtained. Sugarcane is grown on over 20 million ha with an average yield of 64 t/ha to produce a total of 1,25 million t of cane. This is equivalent to about 130 million t of sugar if all the cane were used to produce sugar in moderately efficient factories. Centrifuged sugar production from cane is much less, as large quantities of cane are used to produce alcohol, particularly in Brazil as a liquid fuel. Sims D (pers. comm.)

It has hairy leaves and tubular flowers, white or pink with purplish-red spots. The capsules are erect, 5 cm long and awl-shaped and the seeds are about 3-4 mm long, 2 mm broad and 1 mm thick. USES  The seeds are edible, they can be fried and eaten in soups, mixed with sugar as a sweet, or used in or on bread, cakes and pastry. The seeds are extracted for an oil used in margarines, soaps, paints, salad dressings, cooking oils, as an aromatic lamp oil, as a carrier for pharmaceuticals and perfume, and as a synergist for pyrethin insecticide sprays. The expressed seed cakes can be fed to livestock and are sometimes also used for human consumption. Young leaves are used as a soup vegetable. Various parts of the plant have medicinal porperties. The stems are burnt as fuel. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species. GROWING PERIOD  Annual, maturing in 40-180 days. Most cultivars mature in 80-100 days, while some require 100-180 days. COMMON NAMES  Sesame seed, Sesamo, Sesam, Sesame, Sesamier, Simsim, Benniseed, Benue oil seed, Bebefin, Bene, Ridi, Beme, Poeuloel, Molekelele, Ufuta, Yanmoti, Gingelly, Til. FURTHER INF  Scientific synonym: S. orientale, S. alatum, S capense, S. sabulosum. Sesame's main distribution is between 25°S and 25°N, but it can be found up to 40°N and 35°S. In East Africa, sesame is normally grown at elevations between sea level and 1500 m, but it can be found up to 1800 m and in the Himalays up to 2000 m. The species is probably indigenous to Ethiopia. Sesame is susceptible to wind damage after the main stem has elongated and high relative humidity or heavy rains may increase the incidense of fungal diseases. The average yield of sesame seed in the world is about 350 kg/ha but yields can be up to 3.0 t/ha. SOURCES (S. indicum L.) Sims D (pers. comm.)

Leaves alternate, imparipinnate, short-stalked, 10-30 cm long, 5-15 cm wide, the leaflets opposite or alternate, very unequal in size and shape, the larger often petiolulate, ovate to ovate-oblong, enequilateral, apically acuminate to acute, basally subcordate, 2-10 cm long, 1-6 cm wide, the smaller more blunt apically, more cordate basally, broadly ovate to orbicular, 2ˆ15 mm in diameter, thinly to densely pubescent. Flowers white or blue, pedunculate in lateral, many flowered cymes, the hairy peduncle 5-15 cm long, the jointed hairy pedicels 3-35 mm long. Calyx campanulate, 5-lobate, 1.5-2 cm in diameter, the lobes acute or acuminate. Corolla twice as long as calyx, 3.5-4 cm in diameter. Anthers free, erect, poricidal, yellow. Fruit a globose 2-celled berry, many-seeded, yellowish green. The tubers are mostly located within the top 25 cm of the soil. USES: It is cultivated for its edible tubers. Tubers are one of the temperate staples, eaten boiled, baked, fried, stewed, candied with syrup, or pureed and they are processed into fried chips, starch, flour, glucose, and alcohol and they can be canned or dehydrated etc. Surplus potatoes are used for fodder and alcohol, and chemurgic applications. The flour can be used for baking. Potato starch is used to determine the diastatic value of starch. Boiled with weak sulphuric acid, potato starch is changed into glucose and fermented into alcohol. It is estimated that potatoes would give 104 liters ethanol per ton of production. Rotten potatoes and the waste in the potato chip industry can be converted to butanol with a greater energy content than ethanol. Twenty percent butanol can be added to regular gas and up to 40% to diesel as extenders without engine modification. Ripe potato juice is excellent for cleaning cottons, silks, and woolens. Root and leaf diffusates of growing potato plants possess cardiotonic activity. Dried ethanol extracts of above-ground parts show marked hypotensive and myotropic action and a spasmolytic and soothing effect on intestinal musculature. Ethanol extracts of leaves have antifungal properties, active against Phytophthora infestans. Leaves, seeds, and tuber extracts show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The tubers contain 8-28% starch and 1-4% protein. KILLING T.: -1 C. GROWING PERIOD: Short-lived perennial, grown as an annual, growing 90-160 days. COMMON NAMES: Potato, spud, Irish potato, English potato, pomme de terre, papa, patata, kartoffel, aardappel, alv, watalu, kentang, yang shu, shue tsai, viazi, poni, turma, batata, aardappel, bareisko, jyagaima, ganja, alu, toru, cartoful, hardoppel. FURTHER INF.: The green parts of the potato plant contain toxins. Flowers are common but fruits are only set in cool climates or under a day length of 16-17 hours. The fruits are berries, similar to small tomatoes. Ranging from Boreal Moist to Wet through Tropical Very Dry to Wet Forest Life Zones, potato is reported to tolerate annual precipitations of 900 to 4100 mm, annual temperatures of 3.6 to 27.8 C and a pH of 4.2 to 8.2. Potatoes are a cool weather crop, the optimal temperature for growth being 15-20 C for most cvs. Growth of tubers is best at a soil temperature of 17-20 C, with usually no tubers formed above 32 C. They perform well on a wide variety of soils, sandy loams, silt loams, loams, and peats. Soil moisture tensions between 40 and 60 centibars seem to produce the best yields. The species is native to the Andean mountains between 10 N and 20 S. The latitudinal range is 60 N to 40 S. In the tropics, potato can be grown at altitude between 400-2500 m.

c2380e97-c124-486a-b12d-ec5437de8158,Sorghum bicolor var. sweet,"(L.) Moench Liliopsida:Commelinidae:Cyperales:Gramineae Sorghum vulgare Pers. broom-corn, sorghum, sweet sorghum, chicken corn, sorgho, sorgo, ipwa, bachanta, tinkish, Hirse 1982 DESCRIPTION: A single-stemmed grass and cereal crop reaching a height of 1-5 m; it is usually taller than grain sorghum. It has a strong root system and a layer of heavy disilicate covers the epidermis of the root. As the root grows to maturity it forms an entire silicon column; which provides it with enough mechanical density during a drought period to prevent the root system from collapsing. It has fibrous, spreading roots and consists of a primary, secondary and supporting roots. The primary root is developed from the seed embryo. It is the only embryo root produced by the seed during germination. Before the production of secondary roots, the primary root is the main organ by which the plant absorbs nutrients and moisture from the soil. Prop roots may grow from culm nodes. There is a bud at each node from which a tiller may grow. The only temporary root in sorghum is the single radicle of the germinating seedling. Mature roots of sorghum are all adventitious. Those permanent roots have numerous branched lateral roots interlacing the soil in all directions. The system may extend to at least 1.5 m away from the plant, and is most abundant in the top 90 cm, although it may extend to twice that depth. One of the important factors affecting water use and drought endurance must be the effectiveness of the root system. While the primary roots of maize and sorghum are equally extensive, sorghum possesses twice as many secondary roots as maize at any one stage of growth. After the plant produces 3-4 leaves, secondary roots grow out from the base of the stalk node near the soil surface. The stalk has about 10-20 clearly protruding nodes and a leaf is produced from every node. Leaves (30-135 cm long and 6-13 cm wide) are opposite-decussate and consist of the sheath, blade and tongue or ligule. The sheath is very long and adheres closely to a major part of the internode. The blade is broad, strap-like, dentate and the surface is smooth and covered with a waxy powder which plays a role in reducing evaporation. In dry conditions, the leaf blade will roll up into a tube, reducing the exposed area and thus cutting down the loss of moisture. Flowers are grouped in an apical panicle formed by several reddish spikelets. The grain is an oblong caryopsis; which consists of the seed coat, testa, endosperm and embryo. The shapes and colours of seeds are very varied and are covered by glumes and there are round, flat-round, oval, ellipse shapes etc. The colours include white, light yellow, pink, brown, red-brown, dark brown etc. In general, the seed of sweet sorghum is smaller than that of grain sorghum; the thousand-seed weight is about 21g varying between 16-28g. (25,000 to 61,740/kg for sweet and grain sorghum; 120,000 to 159,000/kg for grass sorghum). USES: The versatility of sweet sorghum resulted in Prof. Li Dajue (of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Peter Griffee (FAO) coining the name the ""Four F's Crop"" for sweet sorghum in 1997 at the first International Sweet Sorghum Conference. The ""Four Fs"" represent the four potential outputs from sweet sorghum, namely: Food, Fuel, Fodder, & Fibre. In Asia, R&D has concentrated on maximizing all four outputs to produce the 'multi-purpose' varieties, whilst in Europe, the potential use of sweet sorghum as a sugar producer for fuel ethanol production has driven the current direction of R&D towards liquid bio-fuel production. In southern Africa, the potential for using sweet sorghum for energy and crystalline sugar production is being explored. A disadvantage is that the stems have to be processed within a matter of hours after harvest. However, new technology is emerging for in-field juice extraction and storage to extend the factory processing period. The grain can be ground into flour, some cultivars can be used as popcorn and the grain can be manufactured into beer. Stems are used for thatching, fencing, brushes, and basketry. A dye can be extracted. Grain and straw can be fed to livestock and embryos yield an oil used in cooking and salad oils. The inflorescence has astringent, haemostatic and antidiarrhoeic properties and administration is as infusion, tincture and medicinal wine. GROWING PERIOD: Annual or short-term perennial grass. Most sorghum plants take 90-120 days to mature, the boot stage is reached in 50-60 days, flowering in 60-70 days and full grain maturity in 90-120 days. COMMON NAMES: Sorghum, Sorgho, Sorgo, Great millet, Milo, Jowar, Cholam, Guinea corn, Durra, Mtama, Jowal, Jolar, Cholam, Koaliang. FURTHER INF.: Lowland tropical sorghums are adapted to warm days and night temperatures above 22°C throughout the growing season. The poisonous glucocide 'dhurrin' in sorghum is present from germination, increasing to a maximum and then disappearing as the grain develops, so that in the later stages the plants is safe as fodder. New long day varieties exist. The photosynthesis pathway C4III. The species is probably indigenous to North-East Africa, north of latitude 10°N and east of longitude 25°E. Sorghum is grown between 40°N and S. Sweet sorghum can be found at elevations between sea level and 1500 m, most East African sorghum is grown between the altitudes of 900-1500 m, and cool-tolerant varieties are grown between 1600 and 2500 m. The nutrient removal for 1 ton of grain is about 50 kg N, 9 kg P, and 45 kg K, calculated from the above-ground plant mass. Grain yields of up to 4 t/ha can be obtained, but in the driest areas, the yield usually varies between 0.3-1.2 t/ha, and the global average is about 1.3 t/ha. Like the common grain sorghum, sweet sorghum can produce grain yields of 1500-7500 kg/ha. But the essence of sweet sorghum is not from its seed, but from its stalk; which contains sugar. In general, the stalk yield is 45000-75000 kg/ha. The sugar content in the juice of sweet sorghum varies in different varieties. It's Brix ranges generally from between 15-23%. Genetic resources: There is a wide varaition in seed type from Beijing Botanical Garden's sweet sorghum germplasm collection. ICRISAT is involved in diversification of sorghum breeding populations, and ultimately cultivars available to farmers, through the incorporation of traits and genetic materials that have not previously been used in crop improvement. For example, new random-mating populations have been produced using diverse germplasm selected for resistance to head and stem pests, earliness with high grain and biomass yield, tillering ability, large grain and resistance to grain molds. ICRISAT initiated a program for the identification and development of sweet-stalked and high-biomass sorghum hybrid parents and varieties in 2002. Promising lines such as ICSB 631 and ICSB 264 among the seed parents; and Seredo, ICSR 93034, S 35, ICSV 700, ICSV 93046, E 36-1, NTJ 2 and Entry 64 DTN among the varieties/male parents were identified for their high stalk sugar content. The sugar percentage in these seed parents and varieties ranged from 16.8% to 21.6%. Four of these lines, S 35, ICSV 700, ICSR 93034 and Entry 64 DTN are being evaluated in the All India Coordinated Sorghum Improvement Program (AICSIP). A Special/Sweet Sorghum Hybrid (SSH) 104 developed from ICSA 38, an ICRISAT-bred male-sterile (seed) parent and SSV 84, a male parent bred in India is being recommended for release for commercial cultivation. The national sorghum program, through extensive testing in AICSIP, released a sweet-stalk sorghum variety SSV 84 in 1992/93 for general cultivation. The wide variability available in germplasm and hybrid parents for the traits related to ethanol production such as percentage of sugar, sucrose and Brix (a measure for sugar content in liquids) and high stalk yield offers bright scope for the development of high stalk yielding sugar-rich varieties and hybrids. The EMBRAPA National Centre of Maize and Sorghum Research in Brazil has also developed new sweet sorghum varieties and work closely with ICRISAT. Sims D (pers. comm.)

d20500b9-6565-4a24-b0a2-67a894cbcf91,Theobroma cacao,"L. Magnoliopsida:Dilleniidae:Malvales:Sterculiaceae cocoa, cacao, koko, Kakao 2074 DESCRIPTION: A small semi-deciduous cauliflorous tree 5-10 m high with a foliage canopy of 4-5 m in diameter when about 10 years old. When fully developed the taproot is 0.8-2 m deep. Lateral roots arise along its entire length but only develop to any great extent in the upper portion, usually from the collar to 15-20 cm down. Up to 10 branched lateral roots may develop in the topsoil covering a 5-6 m radius and with a mass of root hairs. The main trunk is short; branches in whorls of 5, dimorphic; vertical chupons growing from the trunk have leaves arranged in 5/8 phyllotaxy. The lateral branches (fans) have 1/2 phyllotaxy. Stems initially develop orthotropically then in successive elongation phases up to 18 months with a 1-1.5 m trunk. Further growth is interrupted by the degeneration of the terminal bud, below which the first 3-5 branch meristems develop simultaneously, in the form of a whorl growing horizontally. These fan branches form the framework of the tree and are refereed to as a 'jorquette'. The young leaves, which appear either as the trunk develops or during the flushes, are very often pigmented. They appear in accordance with a 3/8 phyllotaxy arrangement. Their colour may vary, depending on the tree type, from pale green, to pink, to deep purple. The young leaves are limp and pendant; as they mature, they become dark green and rigid. The leaves are coriaceous or chartaceous, alternate, and distichous on normal branches. The petiole has 2 joined pulvini, one at the base and the other at the point of insertion of the leaf. Stipules 2, deciduous. Lamina elliptical-oblong or obovate-oblong, simple, 10-45 cm long; generally smooth, sometimes hairy, rounded and obtuse at the base, pointed apex. The inflorescence is dichasial; primary peduncle very short, often thick and lignified. Flower peduncle 1-4 cm long. Sepals 5, triangular, whitish or reddish in colour. Petals 5, joined at the base into a cuplike structure, whitish-yellow with dark purple bands adaxially; ligules spathulate, yellowish. Stamens 5, fertile, alternating with 5 staminodes, the 2 whorls uniting to form a tube. Anthers 2, stamens fused. Ovary superior with a single style terminating in 5 sticky stigmatic surfaces. The fruit is 10-15 cm long and yellow or purplish and is variable in shape, ovoid, oblong; sometimes pointed and constricted at the base or almost spherical, with 10 furrows of which 5 are prominent. Axial placentation, the seeds (embedded in mucilage) flat or round with white or purple cotyledons. The fruit is attached to the branch or trunk by a woody stalk which was originally the stalk of the flower but which thickens as the pod develops. The pericarp or cortex of the pod consists of three distinct layers; the hairy and thick epicarp, which is more or less hard (the epidermis of which may be pigmented); the mesocarp, which is thin and hard and more or less woody; and the hairy endocarp, which is of varying thickness. Pods generally contain an average of thirty to forty seeds, an estimate which is convenient for a rough evaluation of yield in the plantation. However, the number of seeds per pod varies enormously. The cocoa seed or fresh bean is shaped rather like a plump almond, and is surrounded by a white mucilaginous pulp; which is both sweet and rather sour. The average dimensions of the seed are 20-30 mm in length, 12-16 wide and 7-12 thick. Cocoa seeds readily germinate when sown and do not pass through a dormancy period. They lose viability within 5-7 days of extraction from the pod unless specially treated, and germinate within 7-10 days. The plant can easily be propagated vegetatively by leaf-bud cutting, multiple-bud cutting, marcotting, budding, grafting and layering. USES: Food: The cocoa bean, with up to 50% fat, is a valuable source of vegetable fat: cocoa butter. The residual cocoa powder is used in cakes, biscuits, chocolate, drinking chocolate and other confectioneries. Fodder: The cocoa-pod husk has a low alkaloid content, while tannin is practically absent and husks are used as stock feed. The crude fibre content is low; it is completely unlignified and compares favourably with and . Fuel: The cocoa bean testa has a calorific value of 16 000-19 000 BTU/kg, a little higher than that for wood. Lipids: The ash from pod husks contains potassium oxide, which can be extracted in the form of potassium hydroxide, a useful alkaline in the saponification process. Cocoa-bean fat from unfermented cocoa beans can be extracted and used in soap making. Alcohol: The cocoa-pod husk can be hydrolysed under pressure for fermentation into alcoholic drinks. Medicine: Cacao butter can be used in cosmetics and has medical properties. The rural people in Amazonas State, Brazil, rub cocoa butter on bruises. Soil improver: There is considerable nutrient cycling through the development of a deep leaf litter under the cocoa canopy. Intercropping: Cocoa has traditionally been established in thinned forest following logging and 1-3 years of food-crop production before the canopy closes. Crops such as maize, cocoyam, yams and plantain are commonly intercropped with cocoa in Ecuador, Jamaica and West Africa. KILLING T.: Temperatures of about 5 C, even for a short period, may damage cacao but it is grown in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where normal winter temperatures reach 4-6 C. The tree is damaged by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial tree, that begins fruiting after 3-5 years and bears well up to an age of 30-40 years, or even 60 years in the best soils before yields begin to decline. Fruit and seed require 180-300 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: (Burmese): kokoe, (English): cacao, chocolate tree, cocoa, Nicaraguan cocoa shade, (French): cacao, cacaotier, cacaoyer, (German): Kakaobaum, (Indonesian): coklat, (Khmer): kakaaw, (Malay): pokok coklat, (Sinhala): maikona gaha, (Spanish): cacao amarillo, cacao criollo, cacao forastero, (Tamil): kona maram, (Thai): kho kho. FURTHER INF.: The generic name comes from the Greek ?theos? (god), and ?broma? (food) and means the ?food of the gods?. In its natural habitat it is an under-storey plant of forest in the wet humid tropics. In most of the producing countries of America, Asia or Oceania, permanent shading is provided by specially-planted trees, most commonly , , various Erythrinae or even Albizia species. Finally, other industrial crops are often used as permanent shading for the cocoa tree, the coconut palm in particular. Of other crops there have been several attempts to intercrop cocoa trees with rubber, oil palm, areca palm ( ) or even with nutmeg ( ). When planted at their normal density, all these plants produce too much shade for the cocoa trees, which develop as far as vegetation is concerned, but produce very few pods. Cacao originated in the Upper Amazon region in South America. It can be grown between 20°N and S, but the bulk of the crop is grown within 10°N and S, usually below 300 m in elevation but it can be found up to 700 m, and exceptionally up to 1500 m in equatorial regions. The photosynthesis pathway is C3. Cacao is best adapted to 75-86% relative humidity at 09.0 hours, and 51-72% at 15.0 hours, above this humidity level the risk of diseases is increased. Young seedlings have a shade requirement for optimal growth, but for the mature crop optimal yield can only be obtained under full sunlight. Situations where the temperature frequently falls below 18.8 C, or rises above 32.2 C are said to be unfavourable. Cacao is sensitive to strong winds. The amount of nutrients removed in the harvest is not very high if the fruit shells are brought back to the plantation and used as mulch. One ton of cacao beans remove about 20 kg N, 4 kg P, and 10 kg K from the field. Optimum yield of dry beans is more than 2.0 t/ha, while average yields in Africa vary between 0.2-1.0 t/ha. It takes 16-30 kg of pods to produce 1 kg of dry cacao. Cacao is naturally out-breeding, and various insects are associated with its pollination, the main ones being thrips, midges, ants and aphids. It has a complex system of self-incompatibility. After successful pollination, fertilization takes place within 36 hours; the sepals, petals and staminodes drop away and the stamens and pistil wither. The young pod, known as the cherelle, begins to develop by longitudinal elongation, followed by increase in width. The period between fertilization and pod maturation varies from 150 to 180 days, depending on the variety. The pod turns light yellow when ripe and is ready for harvesting at this stage. Fermented seeds are roasted, cracked and ground to give a powdery mass from which fat is expressed. Cacao has the distinction of being a birthplace of IPM and over the last 30 years cocoa has increasingly become a smallholder cash crop. An estimated 80% of the world's cocoa is now produced by smallholders. Sims D (pers. comm.)

The roots of the wheat plant may be divided into two groups, namely, the seminal roots, or those belonging initially to the embryo, or which develop later from the hypocotyl or near it, and the adventitious roots, which spring from the nodes of the plant, within the soil or just above it. The terminal four to seven internodes of the shoot elongate to form the flowering stem or culm and internode elongation is complete by the time of anthesis. Internodes increase in final length from the base of the culm to the uppermost internode, which carries the ear, the peduncle. The basal internodes are shorter than the enclosing sheath of the subtending leaf, while the peduncle and the penultimate internode are longer than enclosing sheaths, revealing a length of bare stem and carrying the emerged ear clear of the sheath. Sometimes in environmentally stressful conditions internode elongation is restricted and the ear remains partially enclosed in the flag leaf sheath. The strong, thickened sheaths of the culm leaves are structurally important for stem strength and stiffness and the knot or pulvinus is instrumental in carrying the ear aloft if the plant is lodged. The leaf is divided at the ligule into a cylindrical sheath and the flat blade or lamina. The sheath is tubular at the base but nearer to the blade it is split with the margins overlapping. The lamina has a fairly well marked midrib, along which runs the major vascular bundle of the leaf. It divides the blade into two sub-equal parts, each of which has a number of parallel lateral ribs or veins. Each vein marks the position of a vascular bundle and the tissue over the bundle is raised producing a ridge, so that the adaxial surface of the blade is corrugated. The abaxial surface is more or less flat. The midrib extends down into the sheath for a short distance as a pronounced ridge. The leaf blade naturally assumes a twist and just below the tip, usually about two-thirds along the leaf there is frequently a constriction. This constriction is produced by the constraint upon growth produced by the closely investing ligule of the subtending leaf during development. The ligule is a thin colourless flap of tissue about 1-2 mm in length, which encircles the leaf or the culm above it beyond where the blade diverges. Associated with the ligule are the auricles, two small ear like projections fringed with unicellular hairs. At the base of the leaf sheath of the culm leaves there is a thicker zone, called variously the joint knot or pulvinus. It is considerably thicker and generally lighter green than the sheath above or the stem below. The node of the stem is below the joint and its position is marked by a slight constriction of the stem. The joint has an important function lifting the ear of a lodged stem off the ground and restoring it to a more or less vertical position. Leaf shape and size change with leaf position. The lowermost leaf on the main shoot has parallel sides to within 1 cm or so of the tip so that the tip itself is characteristically blunt. The leaves above the first have more or less parallel sides for about two-thirds their length above which they taper to a sharp point. The last leaf produced upon the culm, the flag leaf, tapers from about the lower third giving the leaf an elongated ovate shape. In spring wheat lamina length increases with increasing leaf number from the base, reaching a maximum one or two leaves before the flag leaf after which the length declines so the flag leaf is somewhat shorter than the longest leaf. Lamina width increases with leaf position so that the flag leaf is the widest leaf. Sheath length also increases with leaf position, markedly so for the culm leaves. Winter wheat shows comparable size changes, but associated with the long vegetative period the first-produced leaves show little change. Heteroblastic development is also seen in some anatomical features of the leaf. In the inflorescence each spikelet comprises an axis, the rachilla, which bears two glumes and a number of florets. Within each spikelet there are usually from two to four potentially fertile florets. The caryopsis is a dry indehiscent fruit. The dorsal side (with respect to the spikelet axis) is smoothly rounded while the ventral side has the deep crease. The embryo or germ is situated at the point of attachment of the spikelet axis and the distal end has a brush of fine hairs. The embryo is made up of the scutellum, the plumule and the radicle. The scutellum is the region that secretes some of the enzymes involved in germination and absorbs the soluble sugars from the breakdown of starch in the endosperm. The pollen grain, which has a life span of about 5 hours, when settled on a stigma germinates in about 1.5 hours to produce a pollen tube. This grows down the style, between the cells, and eventually reaches and enters the embryo sac via the micropyle. Wheat is a self-pollinating crop with a very low percentage of cross-pollination - from 1-4%. USES: Wheat is one of the most important food plants of man. It enters into international trade more than any other food. The economic stability of many nations is affected by the exchange in wheat. Wheat is utilized mainly as flour (whole grain or refined) for the production of a large variety of leavened and flat breads, and for the manufacture of a wide variety of other baking products such as biscuits, and confectionary. Fermented grains are made into various alcoholic drinks and industrial alcohol. Starch is used as cloth-stiffeners. Straws are fed to livestock, used for animal bedding and used in basketry and woven products. According to the phytomass files, annual productivity ranges from 4 to 18 MT/ha. Chaff is estimated to constitute 25% of the grain. Wheat straw is calculated at 1/2-2 times grain yield, more frequently, 1-1/2 times. However, in some countries, wheat biomass averages more than 6 MT/ha, double this if double cropped. The highest phytomass figure is 18 MT/ha/yr. The seeds are used in folk remedies for cancers, corns, tumors, warts, and whitlow. Reported to be antivinous, bilious, demulcent, discutient, diuretic, emollient, excipient, intoxicant, laxative, useful as a poultice, restorative, sedative, used as a shampoo and vulnerary, common wheat is a folk remedy for burns, cancer, diarrhea, dysentery, ecchymosis, epistaxis, fertility, fever, flux, gravel, hematuria, hemoptysis, hemorrhage, incontinence, leprosy, leucorrhea, menorrhagia, neurasthenia, night sweat, perspiration, scald, tumor, warts, whitlow, and wounds. KILLING T.: Winter wheat may withstand -20°C in the early and dormant stages, later it is like spring wheat and is sensitive to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Some cultivars of wheat are winter annual (winter wheat) and are sown in the autumn others are annual and sown in the spring (spring wheat). Normally the severity of the winter determines whether winter or spring types are grown. If winters are severe spring types are used, if winters are less cold, winter cultivars are grown. Sown in the autumn it may be harvested after 180-250 days, sown in the spring it may require 90-130 days. COMMON NAMES: Common wheat, wheat, bread wheat, blé, trigo, weizen. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: T. cereale Schrank, Baier., T. hybernum L., T. sativum Lam., T. vulgare. Wheat is grown from the tropics to 60 N and 40 S. In temperate regions and in the subtropics it can be grown at altitudes from sea level to 3000 m, in the tropics between 1500-3700 m or where suitable conditions exist in the lowlands. In the tropics and subtropics, it is grown only during the winter season. Principal wheat-growing areas of the world have similar growing conditions: the Russian prairies, the fertile pampas of Argentina, the Wheat belt of United States, all have fertile dark soils rich in nitrogen; rather hot, cloudless summers; rainfall which, although low, is well-distributed. A good wheat soil has physical structure, which holds together, making good water retention and favorable conditions for nitrate formation. Hot, humid conditions are unfavorable for wheat growing. Wheat prefers a low humidity of about 10%; high humidity encourages disease infestation, especially in combination with high temperatures. The photosynthesis pathway is C 3:1. The production of one ton of wheat removes 20-30 kg N, 6-8 kg P, and 20-28 kg K from the field; this includes the mineral contents in the grain plus the straw. The optimum yield of grain in temperate regions is 6.3 t/ha; the optimum yield in the tropics is 2.5 t/ha, while the average yield in Africa is 1.5 t/ha. Sims D (pers. comm.)

Hassk. cow pea, cowpea, southern pea (USA), yard long bean, pois inconnu, pois manger cochon, frijol de vaca, jiangdou, caupí, boeme, catjang, niebe, pois liane 2153 DESCRIPTION: It is a herbaceous, prostrate, climbing, or sub-erect to erect legume, growing 15-80 cm high. Erect and bushy to prostrate and creeping growth habits exist depending on cultivar and growing conditions. Cowpeas develop strong root systems that have many spreading laterals in the surface soil. The stems have circular sections and are pock marked. They are sometimes slightly grooved and are glabrous. The texture is fibrous and hard, firm and not inflated when young. Leaves are alternate and trifoliolate and the leaflets are oval, pointed (6-15 cm x 4-11 cm). They are generally entire and sometimes lobed. Genotypes vary in the degree of pubescence, but all cultivated cowpeas are less glabrous than other legumes such as common bean and soybean. Stipules are spurred at the base, stipels are hardly visible. Inflorescence racemose, flowers white, cream, yellow, mauve or purple. Pods usually occur in pairs forming a V, and are non-dehiscent. Pod orientation is mostly pendant and vertical. Pod length ranges from 6.5-25 cm and the width ranges from 3-12 mm. Under warm conditions, pod development is rapid and may take only two weeks from pollination to pod maturation. Each pod holds from 8 to 20 seeds in a crowded orientation. Seed length is between 6-11 mm and the width is from 4-9 mm. The testa colour also varies from white, pinky-white, pink, tan, brown, and black. The hylum is often ringed black or brown, strongly contrasting with the shade of the testa and hence the name ""blackeyed beans"" of the Antilles. The testa is thick and of ellipsoid and more or less rounded form. Number of seeds per kg is from 4600 up to 16000. USES: Cowpea is one of the most important grain legumes in Africa and in parts of the Americas and Asia. In addition to its dry grain, fresh-shelled 'peas', fresh pods, and fresh and dried leaves and flowers are consumed in some regions. The plant is used as cut and carry forage, and for hay and silage. Cowpea forms highly effective associations with a wide range of native nitrogen fixing strains of Rhizobium bacteria and with mycorrhizae that allows the species to tolerate poor soils. Used as a green manure, it can be incorporated into the soil 8-10 weeks after sowing, and can provide the equivalent of 80 kg/ha N to a subsequent crop. KILLING T.: It is susceptible to frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. Some cowpea accessions may start flowering 30 days after sowing and are ready for harvest of dry seeds 25 days later; others may take more than 90 days to flower, and 210-240 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: Cowpea, crowder pea, clack-eyed pea, couthern pea, atimbawini, boeme, boontjie, catjang, caupí, frijol de vaca, imbumba, isihlumaya. FURTHER INF.: It is native of West Africa and cultivated throughout the tropics and subtropics between 40ºN and 30ºS at elevations between sea level and 2000 m. Occurs in areas with annual rainfall between 400-2000 mm and summer temperatures between 25-35°C. Found on a wide range of very acid (pH 4) to strongly alkaline also low-fertility soils from sands to heavy, well-drained clays, with a preference for lighter soils. It does not tolerate extended flooding or salinity. Most cowpea accessions exhibit classic short-day responses with respect to time of flowering, although a range of sensitivities occur and the effect is modulated by temperature. It is mainly autogamous and in most environments outcrossing is low (less than 5%), but in the presence of bumble bees or other large insects, out-crossing can be much higher. Flowers open early in the morning, close by noon and may fall off during the same day. The photoperiodism of many African landraces confers adaptation to a specific latitude and rainfall pattern such that flowering and pod development coincide with the end of the rainy season in a particular place ensuring that pods mature in dry weather thus avoiding pod rots and other diseases. The photosynthetic pathway is C3 and the leaves have full maximal rates of photosynthesis at full expansion. Vegetative DM production 3-10 t/ha in 8-12 weeks; grain production 250-4000 kg/ha.

Fruit a berry, ellipsoid to globose, 6-25 mm long, dark blue-purple, red, green or yellow, juicy, sweet or sour. USES: Fruits are eaten raw or dried, pressed for juice, fermented as wine, or made into jams and jellies. Residue from pressed grapes is fed to livestock or used to make tannin and cream of tartar. Grape seeds yield a drying oil used for lighting, paints and cooking. Young leaves are eaten as a vegetable. KILLING T.: Dormant vines may withstand -12°C to -20°C, new shoots and leaves are damaged at 0°C to -5°C. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, may be harvested after 160-180 days for early cultivars, and 190-270 days for late cultivars.

FURTHER INF.: The European wine grape is belived to have originated in the area between the Black and the Caspian seas, where it still grows wild. It is predominantly grown between 20-50°N and from 20-40°S but it can also be grown in the tropics at altitudes between 300 and 2000 m. Photosynthesis pathway C3. A sheltered, warm situation, and a long warm, or hot and dry summer is best, and the plants grow most satisfactorily when the winter is sufficiently severe to ensure a period of complete dormancy each year. High humidity and rainfall during the growing period favours diseases and tends to produce low quality grapes, 60-80% relative humidity is optimum. Light requirements are high, but only the leaves should be exposed and at the same time shield the fruits against the sun. Reported yields are between 10-90 t/ha. Sims D (pers. comm.)

It has many fasciculate roots. The erect shoot (culm) consists of four basic structures: the internodes, the leaves, the prophyll and the bud or apical meristem, which are collectively called the phytomer. The leaves that emerge from its nodes are alternate, lanceolate, acuminate and parallel-veined with small ligules. Maize is a monoecious plant; it develops inflorescences with unisexual flowers, and these are always born in separate parts of the plant. The female inflorescence - the ear, arises from the axillary bud apices, and male inflorescence, the tassel, develops from the apical growing point at the top of the plant. The kernel or fruit of maize is called a caryopsis. The ovary wall or pericarp is fused with the seed coat or testa and these combined together make the fruit wall. The mature fruit consists of three major parts - fruit wall, diploid embryo and triploid endosperm. The outermost layer of the endosperm, in contact with fruit wall is called the aleurone layer. The mature corn kernel is made up of three main parts, the seed coat or pericarp, the starchy endosperm and the embryo often called the germ, which will develop into a new plant. USES: It is mainly grown for food and fodder. The grain is ground to flour and used in starchy foods and breads. It is used in breakfast foods. Fermented grain is made into alcohol, which has become a prime use in the USA. A ton of dried maize would yield about 370 kg of ethanol. Maize starch is used in cosmetics, adhesives, glucose and syrup. Oil is extracted from the embryo and used as salad oil, and to make linolium, paints, varnishes, etc. KILLING T.: It is easily killed by frost. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. In Kenya quick-maturing lowland varieties flower in 60 days and mature in 120 days, varieties grown between 1200-2100 m in elevation flowers in 105 days and mature in 210 days, while varieties grown at 2100-3200 m may take 195 days to flower and more than 365 days to mature. In the United States on average it mature in 90-140 days. FURTHER INF.: Maize is one of the most productive species of food plants being the second most important cereal grain after wheat, with milled rice occupying third place. It is the top ranking cereal in grain yield per hectare and is second to wheat in total production. Maize is of great economic significance worldwide as human food as animal feed, and as a source of large number of industrial products. Maize has tremendous variability in kernel colour, texture, composition and appearance. It is classified into distinct types based on (a) endosperm and kernel constitution; (b) kernel colour; (c) environment in which it is grown; d) maturity; and (e) its use. White, yellow and orange are prominent grain colours. Prominent maize kernel types are flint, dent, pop, sweet, floury, morocho, and waxy. Quality Protein Maize (QPM with improved protein quality), and High Oil Corn are speciality maize types. It can be found at elevations between sea level and 4000 m and it can be grown at latitudes from 48°N to 40°S. The photosynthesis pathway C4 III for tropical lowland types and C4 IV for highland and temperate types. Hot, dry winds may reduce the amount of pollen available for fertilization and humid conditions and hail can do damage. Since the crop leaves much of the ground uncovered, soil erosion and water losses can be severe. The optimum yield is 7-11 t/ha, world average 3.6 t/ha. High yields of maize make a heavy drain on soil nutrients. It is probably indigenous to Mexico and Central America.

Ginger is mainly cultivated in the tropics from sea level to 1500 m and it thrive in hot, moist conditions, but can be grown over more diverse conditions than most other spices. Ginger originated in South East Asia, but is nowhere known in a wild state. When grown on slopes the production may result in severe erosion unless adequate soil-conservation methodes have been employed. Low temperatures will induce dormancy. The expected yield of dried ginger may be 1.5-7.5 t/ha. The dried ginger constitues about 25% of the raw rhizome's weight. Yields of green ginger can be up to 38 t/ha.

Root system dense and close to the surface. Leaves obovate-oblong to elliptic, 6-13 x 3-6 cm. The flower buds 1-2 cm long and the fruit a berry, 2-2.5 cm long and dark red. USES  The clove (the flower bud) is used as a spice and in the production of 'kretek' cigarettes, which are smoked in Indonesia. When used as a spice, the dried cloves are added to the food as such or after grinding, or the oleoresin is extracted to standardize the flavor. The clove and the mother of clove (the fruit) are used for there medicinal properties. Distillation of cloves yields an oil that is used in the flavouring and perfume industry. A lesser quality oil is distilled from the flower stalks and from the leaves. A major componet of this oil is phenol eugenol, used in soaps, detergents, toothpaste and pharmaceutical products. The timber is hard heavy and durable, but has a dull greyish colour. GROWING PERIOD  Perennial.

The tree can be found at elevations between sea level and 1000 m. It occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 15-30°N. Mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. A 12-year-old plantation, 3x3 m spacing, can yield 54 t/ha of fuelwood. Best adapted to hot, dry lowland conditions, the tree is drought hardy, but often found by temporary or permanent waterholes and around wells. It often indicates the tree limit towards the desert. The tree should not be introduced to new areas, with more humid climates, where grazing and firewood are in adequate supply, as it is likely that the species will grow out of control and become a nuisance. It seems that at times the leaves may be toxic.

In the forests where it is native it sometimes climbs up to 15-30 m high into trees. It has a more delicate appearance than regular kiwifruit. The fruit is about 2-2.5 cm long and contain a number of small seeds. It is generally green, fuzzless, and the size of grapes. Cut open, it looks much like regular kiwifruit with its small black seeds, emerald green colour, and typical rayed pattern. USE: The fruit can be eaten raw, cooked or dried and the plant can be grown as an ornamental shade plant on a pergola. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Hardy kiwi, Bower vine, Dessert kiwi, Cocktail kiwi. FURTHER INF: It is native to northern China, Korea, Siberia and possibly Japan. The plants need a long growing season (about 150 frost-free days) which will not be hampered by late winter or early autumn freezes. When fully dormant, they can withstand temperatures to about -30°C. Some cultivars are said to tolerate temperatures down to about -50°C when fully dormant. However they must acclimate to cold slowly and any sudden plunge in temperature may cause trunk splitting and subsequent damage to the vine. It needs a period of winter chilling but late winter freezing temperatures will kill any exposed buds. It can grow in harsher climates than the kiwifruit. It will tolerate some shade but prefer a sunny location where it can ramble across some type of trellising system. Neutral soils are acceptable but the leaves may show nitrogen deficiency when the soils become too basic. http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/hardy-kiwifruit.html http://www.ibiblio.org/pfaf/cgi-bin/arr_html?Actinidia+arguta",http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=2803

The stem is branching, and the leaves many-cleft and sessile. The flowers are large, yellow, and attractive. USE: A toxic principle is present in very small quantities in the plant. It is poorly absorbed so poisoning is unlikely. The plant contains cardiac glycosides similar to those found in the foxglove (Digitalis purpurea). These substances improve the heart's efficiency, increasing its output at the same time as slowing its rate. It also has a sedative action and so is generally prescribed for patients whose hearts are beating too fast or irregularly. The herb is not often prescribed, however, due to irregular absorption. The herb is cardiotonic, diuretic, sedative and vasoconstrictor. It has sometimes been used internally as a cardiotonic with success where the better known foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) has failed - especially where there is also kidney disease. The herb is also used in the treatment of low blood pressure and its strong diuretic action can be used to counter water retention. It is included in many proprietary medicines, especially since its effects are not cumulative. The plants are harvested every third year as they come into flower, they are dried for use in tinctures and liquid extracts. The herb does not store well so stocks should be replaced every year. The plant is used in homeopathy as a treatment for angina. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Pheasant's eye. FURTHER INF: It can be found in eastern South Europe and into Russia. Naturalized in north-eastern United States. Found on sunny grassy hills on dry calcareous soils.

The narrow, conical crown has drooping branches. USES  The wood can be used as pulpwood, for furniture, plywood, woodenware, paneling, fixtures, tool handles, as firewood, and charcoal. It can be planted as an ornamental, for windbreak, and on coal mine spoils. It is mentioned as a possible agroforestry species. KILLING T  The tree may tolerate -34°C. GROWING PERIOD  Perennial. COMMON NAMES  Red alder, Oregon alder, Erle, Aune, Pacific coast alder, Western alder, Aune de l'Oregon. FURTHER INF  Scientific synonym: A. oregana. Red alder is indigenous to a low elevation coastal zone of northwestern North America from Alaska to California. The tree occur naturally within the latitudinal range of 30-60°N and can be found at elevations between sea level and 1000 m. Pure stands are mainly found in stream bottoms, on moist flats, along rivers, in swamps, and on lower slopes. Optimum annual production is 11 m3/ha for the 20-30 year rotations needed to produce pulpwood and small sawlogs, or 21 m3/ha for a short coppice rotation for firewood. Because of its aggressiveness and vigor, the red alder can invade plantations of slower growing trees, overtop them, and become a serious pest. The tree fixes nitrogen and it regenerates rapidly.

It is commonly a component of other plant communities at tops of beaches and on very sandy coastal ground. The tussocks have the ability to grow back through covering sand after being buried and can withstand sand accretion rates of up to 1 metre per year. The tussocks trap wind-blown sand and the root and rhizome growth stabilises the mobile dunes.

Leaves are alternate, odd-pinnately compound, usually with 5 to 7 leaflets. The flowers are usually pink, maroon or brownish-red. They have typical papilionoid legume structure, are about 12 mm long and occur in compact racemes 75 to 130 mm in length. The fruit are 50 to 130 mm long containing six to thirteen wrinkled brown seeds. The brown-skinned, white-fleshed tubers are on underground stems (rhizomes) in branched or unbranched series. They can vary in diameter from 1-20 cm. The plant is able to fix nitrogen. USE: The tubers, which are high in protein and starch, may be used for food after cooking. The large seeds are similar to peas, and are also edible. The Native Americans in what is now eastern United States made extensive use of the plant. It contains some antinutrition factors, such as trypsin inhibitors, so it should be cooked before being eaten. A few people have shown an allergic reaction from eating apios. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Apios. FURTHER INF: It is native of eastern North bAmerica. The vine is killed by frost but the tubers survive winters even into southern Canada. In the wild, they are found mainly in low damp bottomland or riparian woods and thickets growing on brush for support, but may be grown in cultivated fields without support. It is better to grow on a trellis if seed production is desired. Unfortunately, it can become a serious weed in cranberry plots.

Gandular trichomes occur on leaves and especially inflorescences. Artemisinin is sequestered in these trichomes. USE: Artemisinin used in the treatment of malaria. Due to its aggressive fibrous root system it is used for erosion control on slopes. It also makes a graceful accent in the back of a flowerbed or a pretty quick screen and is used in fresh and dried arrangements. GROWING PERIOD: Annual or sometimes biennial. COMMON NAMES: Annual wormwood. FURTHER INF: It is native to Asia, the center of origin is most probably China; wild populations occur both in China and Vietnam. It thrives in many temperate to sub-tropical ecologies. The plant is un-adapted to the tropics because flowering will be induced when the plants are very small; with the possible exceptions of high altitude plateaus and/or regions with a pronounced cool period such as Vietnam where there are two months of low temperatures at the beginning of the season. It can be found on barnyards, farm lots, fallow fields, borders of woods, mudflats along streams and ponds, waste ground, roadsides, railroads, alleys of older cities and in cultivated beds. It has become a weed in many areas of the world. The critical photoperiod seems to be about 13.5 hours, but there are likely to be photoperiod x temperature interactions. Plants are more aromatic and long-lived when grown in a poor dry soil. Wright CW 2002",http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=3392

It require warm, humid, tropical conditions and thrives at elevations below 600 m, but can be found up to about 2000 m and does not thrive far from the sea. It grows best in a relative humidity from 70-90% and occurs within the latitudinal range 23°N-17°S. Young trees grow better under shade but later full sun is required. The trees shed their leaves under dry conditions and are said to shed the fruit when the soil is excessively wet. Cultivars differ greatly in their tolerance of adverse conditions and there are cultivars that cope well with shallow, calcareous soils, brackish water and salt sprays. Optimal yields of 0.7-3.5 t or up to 700 fruits per tree can be expected from a mature tree. In the South Pacific, average yields may be 50-150 fruits per tree, in India 200 fruits and in Barbados the yields may be 16-30 t/ha.

Hern. cohune palm, rain tree, American oil palm, cohune, corozo, manaca 3560 DESCRIPTION: It is handsome and majestic feather palm reaching 5-20 or even 30 m in height. USE: The heart of the palm, located in the last four feet of the trunk before the base of the leaf stems, is considered a delicacy. It can be cut pieces and eaten raw. In a survival situation, also the inner bark is edible but much tougher than the heart itself. The fruits are eaten fresh and made into sweet meats. Also the seed can be eaten fresh. Palm wine is produced from the heart of the palm and its sap. The fruits are used as livestock feed. The bark can be fed to pigs and chickens. The seeds yield oil which is used extensively as a lubricant, for cooking, soap making and lamp oil. The leaves are used as thatching material for roofs. It is one of nature's largest and most majestic palms. It is very well suited for plantings on campuses, parks and public gardens. Even young trees may be planted in areas receiving full sun and are very resistant to wind damage. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. COMMON NAMES: Cohune palm, Rain tree, American oil palm. FURTHER INF: It occurs naturally in Central American tropical rainforests in Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and coastal southern Mexico. It grows best in a sheltered warm spot in a subtropical setting, or in hot and humid tropical environments. Mature and established plants have been reported to tolerate temperatures down to -4 to -5°C, losing 10%-100% of their foliage but recovering during warmer months. It is not tolerant of forest fires, the mortality either being the result of direct damage or indirect damage such as increased pathogen access through the fire damaged bark. http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/ipgri/fruits_from_americas/frutales/Ficha%20Attalea%20cohune.htm",http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=3560

It has a deep root system. The stems are reddish-green, often profusely branched with lateral buds. Leaves are alternate, non-heading with long petioles. The foliage is light green with purplish veins, often light brown glabrous or bearing a few hairs on the ribs. Flowers are usually light yellow about 1,5 cm across, on short pedicels on an extended raceme. Flowers are regular with four free sepals in one series and two sets of stamens. The fruit is a silique, usually less than 5 cm long, stout and broad with carinate angles, usually dehiscent. The seed is large and predominantly dark, small, often globular, 0,2 cm thick, filled with embryo. Although, there are yellow-seeded forms and B. carinata is being investigated as a source of large yellow seeds. The weight of 1000 seeds is approximately 3.5 grams. USES: In Ethiopia the plant is used mainly for its tender leaves and sprouts, which are boiled and eaten especially during periods of fasting, which are numerous among the Coptic people. The cooked vegetable accompanies a starchy staple like maize or cassava meal, banana or potatoes. The name of mustard comes from the use of seed in condiments. Seeds are used for oil. The oil finds wide application in the production of water repellents, waxes, polyesters and lubricants. Seed cake remaining after extraction of oil can be used as fertilizer or feed stuff. It is also used as a green fodder crop, green manure and as a cover crop. Interest in this species for industrial uses has been increasing thanks to the particular acid composition of its extracted oil. The seed oil is used to produce bio-diesel or special erucic acid derivatives. KILLING T.: 0 C at early growth. GROWING PERIOD: Annual. The main phenological stages are:- germination: 5-6 days after sowing - emergence to first flowering: 156 days - first flowering to maturity: 69 days.

The plant has a wide growing range from the UK to North Africa; it is hardy and well adapted to the temperate climatic zones of Europe. The crop is still at an experimental stage. Current work on the crop suggests it may be most suited to semi-arid climates with mild or hot temperatures. Canadian trials suggest it can out-yield the best Brassica napus cultivars in these kinds of environments. The consensus is that the crop could be developed for use in drier areas where Brassica napus is less well adapted; this may include the Mediterranean basin. Developing the crop for use in these areas would allow oilseed production over a greater climatic range. s both heat and drought tolerant but not very resistant to frost; as such best results are achieved by sowing in autumn in Mediterranean areas, whereas in cooler areas (Northern Europe) it is best sown from spring onwards. Sowing date has been found to have a much larger effect on yield than seed rates and, where environments allow, an early autumn sowing is likely to achieve best results.

USES: Turnips are one of the most commonly grown and widely adapted root crops, as a general farm crop or home-garden crop. Roots are eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable and the tops used as a potherb such as spinach. Roots also grown for feeding to livestock during fall and winter. The powdered seed is said to be a folk remedy for cancer. The root when boiled with lard is used for breast tumors. The stems and leaves are said to be a remedy for cancer, while a salve derived from the flowers is said to help skin cancer. The root starch can be used to produce bio-ethanol. KILLING T.: Unhardened plants can survive -4°C, while fully-hardened spring types can survive -10 to -12°C, and hardened winter turnip can survive short periods of exposure to -15 to -20°C. GROWING PERIOD: Biennial, usually grown as an annual, growing 40-80 days for harvest as vegetable, and 55-80 days for harvest of the root. COMMON NAMES: Turnip, turnip rape, navet, nabo forrajero, nabo rutabaga, kohl-rube, koolraap. FURTHER INF.: Scientific synonyms: B. campestris var rapa L., B. campestris var rapifera L. Turnip is native of central and southern Europe. Cultivated in Europe for over 4000 years, probably native to central and southern Europe, now spread throughout world, including most parts of the tropics. In the tropics, it is suitable for elevations above 1000 m and only very few cultivars can be grow at low elevations. Turnip is basically a cool climate crop, resistant to frost and mild freezes. Temperatures below 10°C cause bolting. Turnips do well in deep, friable, highly fertile soil with pH of 5.5-6.8; sandy loams are used for early markets roots and greens. Their short growing season makes them very adaptable as a catch crop. Ranging from Boreal Moist to Rain through Tropical Thorn to Moist Forest Life Zones, it is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 3500 to 4100 mm, an annual temperature of 3.6 to 27.4°C and a pH of 4.2 to 7.8. Light shade is sometimes beneficial for plants grown for leaf consumption and the plant is drought-resistant. Yields are normally between 20-25 t/ha or 2-2.5 kg/m2. 2000-2500 liters of ethanol have been obtained in research trials. Cross-pollination, by various insects, is necessary for good seed production. Seed is sown thinly in spring, summer or autumn in drills at a seed rate of 1.1-2.2 kg/ha. Seedlings then thinned to stand 5-15 cm apart in rows 0.3-0.9 m apart. Cultivate shallowly for weed control. Add lime to soil to correct pH to 5.5-6.8. Only light applications of fertilizer are justified, such as 450-675 kg/ha of 4-12-4. When turnips are seeded as an autumn crop following a crop that has been well fertilized, no additional fertilizer may be necessary. Seed may be broadcast on fertile, well-prepared seedbeds where weed control will not be difficult. Turnips may be intercropped with maize, and as such they are shade-tolerant, or they may be used as a catch crop after early vegetables. It is not advisable to grow turnips after a root crop. Good rotation helps to control diseases. Best grown after clover, beans, peas or grass crop. Roots may be harvested in 45-80 days. They are harvested for bunching when 5 cm in diameter, and for topped turnips when 7.5 cm in diameter. Turnip greens may be harvested when plants are young and tender. For early spring market, turnips are pulled, washed, their tops left on, tied in bunches, and marketed. Flavor and texture are not improved by storage. They should not be left in the ground where temperatures near freezing occur; in milder areas they may be left in field until desired. They may be stored in pits or piles, in well-drained soils. Piles should not be more than 2.6 m wide nor more than 2 m deep to prevent heating at the center. For good aeration, wooden chutes are inserted at intervals of 2.5-3 m in the pile. A ditch is dug around the base of pile for water runoff. Alternate layers of straw and soil are used as covering for pit storage. For indoor storage, crates or small piles laid on earth cellar floors are satisfactory. Small quantities of turnips may be stored in a cool cellar and covered with moistened clean sand to keep them from drying out. Storage temperature in a cellar or in a cold storage room should remain between 0° and 1.5°C, with a relative humidity of 90-95%.

Magnoliopsida:Rosidae:Fabales:Leguminosae carob tree, carob bean tree, carrubo, Johannisbrotbaum, Johannesbrotwachs, carrubio, algarrobo, alfarrobeira, Johannesbroodboom 4426 BRIEF DESCRIPTION  A deciduous or evergreen tree reaching a height of 8-17 m in the wild, but under cultivation it is much smaller. Under unfavourable conditions it may only be a multi-stemmed shrub. The pod may be up to 30 cm long and contain up to 18 seeds. USES  Carob gum is the whitish powder obtained from grinding the endosperm of the seeds. The gum has extensive use in the food industry. It stabilizes ice cream, is used in the preparation of cheeses and extruded meat products, improves the water retention properties of drughs, and is used as an emulsifier and stabilizer in dressings and sauces. It is also used in the textile and paper-making industries and it is used in drilling mud to control the water losses and mud viscosity. The seeds can be used as a coffee substitute and the pods can be fed to livestock. The workable wood is used to make furniture and carts. KILLING T The tree tolerates short periods at -7°C, but dies after long periods of -4 to -5°C. Young trees are more easily damaged. GROWING PERIOD  Long-lived perennial. Begins to bear pods from the 6th or 7th year (5th or 6th when budded). After flowering, the fruit requires 180-240 days to mature. May live for 100 years or more. COMMON NAMES  Carob, St.John`s bread, Locust Bean, Algarroba, Caroubier, Kharoubah, Caroube, Kharuv, Carruba. FURTHER INF  Carob is heat and fire resistant, windfirm and termite resistant, it tolerates salt winds, and drought. It requires wide spacing, has a penetrating root system, and is slow growing. Grown at altitudes between sea level and 1000 m. Humidity should be moderate in winter and low in summer. The species is indigenous to the Middle-East and was traditionally grown within the latitudinal range 27-42°N. Non irrigated and grown in semiarid regions, the optimum yield of pods is 7 t/ha, whereas trees that are irrigated or grown in high rainfall areas may yield up to 12 t/ha. The trees are often planted on hillsides above orange groves. Dew is a limiting climatic factor. Frequent wetting of the leaves enhances the spread of leaf diseases and the tree fails as a commercial crop in areas with more than 220 dew nights per year. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species. SOURCES (Ceratonia siliqua L.) Sims D (pers. comm.)

Flowers white and pinkish arranged in panicles, very fragrant. USE: Its great value as a tonic and febrifuge depends on an alkaloid, Quinine. It yields large amount of this alkaloid,  often 70-80% of the total alkaloids contained in the bark. It has febrifuge, tonic and astringent properties, valuable for influenza, neuralgia and debility. Large and too constant doses must be avoided, as they produce headache, giddiness and deafness. The liquid extract is useful as a cure for drunkenness. The powdered bark is often used in tooth-powders, owing to its astringency, but not much used internally (except as a bitter wine); it creates a sensation of warmth, but sometimes causes gastric intestinal irritation. Cinchona in decoction is a useful gargle and a good throat astringent. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial, start flowering after 3-4 years, and are uprooted and harvested after 8-12 years. COMMON NAMES: Quinine (calisaya), Cinchone, Cincona. FURTHER INF: Tolerant to below 7°C. Quinine occur wild in the Andean rainforests in Peru and Bolivia. It can be grown in the tropics at altitude from 400-3000 m. It grows very poorly or not at all on soils that have been exposed to fire. Grows best in areas with a high relative humidity.

The fruit is a hesperidium. The endocarp (edible portion) is divided into 10-14 sections, separated by thin septa and contains no seed. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. USE: The fruit is edible, it has a sweet-sour taste, it lacks seed, and is easy-to-peel. Its significance on the fresh fruit market has therefore increased. A particular advantage for marketing lies in its early ripening, which allows producers to bring their fruit about two months before oranges and clementines onto the market. Disadvantageous is that, when the fruit is internally ripe and most suitable for consumption, it still lacks ""external"" quality. The irregular coloration of the fruit and sometimes an unusually rough peel tend to make it unattractive to the consumer. Moreover, the yields are not sufficiently reliable to satisfy the producer.

Fabaceae diesel tree, copaiba, copaiba vermelha, copaiba balsam 4837 DESCRIPTION: Evergreen palm up to 35 m tall and 1 m in diameter, normally 6-12 m tall. Leaves 5-10 cm long; leaflets 2-4 pairs, opposite or semi-alternate, petiolulate, elliptic ovoid, 2-6 cm long, 1.2-2.5 cm broad with finely pinnate reticulate nervation. Flowers in terminal racemes to compound panicles with numerous, sub-sessile whitish flowers. Sepals 4 - lanceolate, concave, firm, glabrous outside, pubescent inside. Petals absent. Stamens free, (8-10), the anthers elliptic, versatile. Ovary hirsute; briefly stipitate; fruit ovoid, compressed, ca 2 x 3 cm, coriaceous, with one large seed partially covered with a thick aril. USES: The oleoresin called Œcopaiba‚ can be obtained by drilling a 5cm deep hole into the trunk, which is then closed with a bung. Every 6 months or so, the bung is removed and 15 to 20 litres of a hydrocarbon collected. The wood of the tree is honeycombed with a network of connected cavities in which the oleoresin forms. To tap the tree, a drainage reservoir is hollowed out near its base by cutting inward and downward into the centre of the trunk. The cavities containing the oleoresin gradually drain into these hollowed-out wells. This process is repeated several times during the season. When first obtained, copaiba is thin and clear but on aging becomes thicker and acquires a yellowish tinge. This liquid can be used as a diesel substitute and is used in lacquers, massage preparations, medicines, and paints. Wood and resin can be used for fuel. The wood is used in carpentry. FURTHER INF.: It occurs from subtropical dry to wet through tropical dry to wet forest life zones. Copaiba probably tolerates annual precipitation of 1000 to 4000 mm, annual temperature of 20 to 27°C (with no frost), and pH of 4.5 to 7.5. Early USDA publications suggest that most copaiba comes from regions with annual precipitation of 3500 mm or more and annual temperature ca. 27°C. James A. Duke. 1983. Handbook of Energy Crops.

USES  It is grown as a fiber crop. The fibers are used for coarse  woven fabrics, sacking, or fibers. It is also used in twines and carpet yarns. The soft fibers are weaker than hemp or flax. GROWING PERIOD  Annual, may be harvested after 80-150 days, depending on varirty. COMMON NAMES  White jute, Yute, Jute. FURTHER INF  White jute is native to a region including India, Myanmar and sourthern China. It can be found in tropical lowland and perhaps also highland. It require a humid climate with a relative humidity between 60 and 90% in the growing period, but diurnal fluctuations of up to 50% are not a disadvantage. Young plants are sensitive to waterlogging, but more mature plants will tolerate flooding. White jute is often grown on areas that are inundated every year and enriched by deposits. It is a short-day plant but longer days prolong the vegetative phase and it is therefore normally sown when the day-length exceeds 12.5 hours. White jute is more commonly grown than the closely related, tussa jute (C. olitorius). Yields may be about 34 t/ha of green plants giving 2 t/ha of dry retted fiber. SOURCES (C. capsularis L.)

Magnoliopsida:Rosidae:Santalales:Olacaceae African walnut 4916 DESCRIPTION: It is An evergreen tree reaching 25 m in height, with a large, dense crown casting a deep shade. Form of the bole is generally short, bossed, branched low down, and sometimes slightly swollen at the base, not usually exceeding 6 m in length and 0.8 m in diameter. Bark thin, rather smooth, lenticillate, greenish-brown, slightly fissured. Fruit an ellipsoidal drupe, 3-4 cm long, with an extremely hard kernel. USE: The oily kernel has a taste comparable to that of a chestnut or hazelnut. It can be eaten raw, grilled or boiled. It contains 50% fat, of which 87% is oleic acid. Wood produces suitable charcoal. The sapwood is pinkish-brown, the heartwood is dark red or violet brownish-red. It is extremely hard, heavy, close-grained, and resists water well. It is also resistant to insect attack, particularly termites. It has the disadvantage of being liable to shake and crack. It is used for making piles for bridges and railway ties. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial. Flowering takes place from April to June and the fruit is available from August to January. Fruit is usually found under the mother trees. COMMON NAMES: African walnut. FURTHER INF: It is native of western tropical Africa. It has its main distribution in the rain forest. It tolerates moderate shade and is normally a constituent of the upper reaches of the lower storey but is also found in the upper canopy. It is semi-gregarious and does not appear to be selective about sites. It is a semi-gregarious species without special soil requirements.

Rich., non L. crambe, Abyssinian kale, chou de Abyssinie, colewort, Eurasian oilseed 4922 DESCRIPTION: Erect, annual branched cruciferous herb, up to 1-2 m tall depending on season and plant density, branching mostly in the upper half; leaves large, ovate in outline, pinnately lobed, progressively smaller upward; inflorescence a long panicled raceme, the lateral branches of which are sharply ascending and shorter than the primiary axis. The penetrating tap root can reach depths of over 15 cm enabling the plant to be relatively drought resistant later in the season. Flowering indeterminate; flowers small, whitish (typically the flowering period is about 3 weeks); pods numerous, spherical, one-seeded capsules of about 5mm diameter each containing a single spherical seed greenish-brown in colour and 0.8-2.6 mm diameter, indehiscent; seed interior yellow. First-formed pods usually remain on stalk until last-formed pods mature. One plant may produce 530-1,840 fruits. USES: Crambe appears to be a better potential domestic crop than rapeseed. It is the cheapest source of erucic acid, which performs better than any known material as a mold lubricant in continuous steel casting. Test plantings in Russia, under a wide variety of ecological conditions, gave oil contents of 25-33% for seed with hulls (dehulled seeds reached 54%). There are reported yields of 169-840 kg/ha in Indiana, 2,000 in Missouri, suggesting oil yields of about 60-600 kg/ha. Hull-free seeds contain about 26% protein. Crambe meal is used as plywood and rubber adhesive, as a source of protein isolates, and as an additive to waxes. Crambe meal, after unpalatable material is removed or made inactive, may be used as supplement for ruminants not to exceed one-third to one-half of the supplement; it is not recommended for pigs and poultry. The meal is also used as an insecticide. It is used in crop rotations for alleviating weed, pest and disease build-up. GROWING PERIOD: Annual, From planting to harvest requires about 100 days, but this may vary considerably. It has been adapted as a spring crop. KILLING TEMP: Seedlings may survive -4 to -6°C for short periods, but at all later stages of growth -1°C may kill the plant. COMMON NAMES: Crambe, Colewort. FURTHER INF.: Crambe is probably a native of western Asia. It can be grown at elevations between sea level and 2000 m or even up to 2500 m in Kenya. Hail can cause severe damage to crambe, though it generally will recover. Seed yields vary widely from 1,125-1,624 kg/ha in Russia and 450-2,522 kg/ha in the United States, with yields highest in weed-free fields. In irrigated fields with additional nitrogen, yields up to 5 MT/ha have been attained. Cost of production is about the same as for barley. The major problems are weed control and seed-shattering.

However, the leafy top does not resemble asparagus. The plant grows to 60 cm, with large, heavy, glossy green leaves that are fringed or curled on the edges. The edible, young, tender, whitened shoots arise from the roots each spring. USE: Its name comes from its use on long sea voyages. The Romans stored it in pickled form aboard ship and fed it to the crews to prevent scurvy. In fresh form, it is cooked and used like asparagus. Both the young shoots and very small leaves are eaten. GROWING PERIOD: Perennial herb growing for 3 years. (GMIN and GMAX estimated by the compiler). COMMON NAMES: Seakale, sea-colewort, scurvy grass, and halmyrides.

USES  It is cultivated for its fragrant flowers that yield the dye, saffron. The dye contains the yellow glucoside, crocin, and is used as a colour agent in foods. It is also used as a spice for food and beverage and has medicinal properties. The dye can also be used to colour textiles. GROWING PERIOD  Perennial. Once planted, the corms may remain in the field for 3-12 years, but sometimes saffron is grown as an annual crop. COMMON NAMES  Saffron, Saffron crocus, Safran, Azafran, Kuma-kuma, Sapran, Romiet. FURTHER INF  Saffron probably originated in Greece and western Asia. It thrives best in temperate and fairly dry climates. Two periods of rainfall are adequate for good yields, one in the spring for the production of new corms and a second in the end of the summer to develop blossoms. Frosts and rains during the flowering are harmful and can damage the crop. An average yield is about 1.000.000 flowers per ha, which in turn produces about 10 kg of dried saffron.
